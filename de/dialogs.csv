dlga_start:port_chief2|{s1}
dlga_port_chief2:port_chief3|Was benötigt Ihr?
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_fleet1|Ahoi. Ich kam um mich Sven Stiernackens und Harald Haraldssons Flotte auf ihrer Reise nach Englaland anzuschließen.
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_bodoletter1|Ein Mann namens Atli Eiríksson verließ diesen Hafen vor einiger Zeit. Wisst Ihr, wohin er wollte?
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_pieles|Ich habe die Felle, die Ihr verlangt habt, Hogni gegeben. Jetzt seid Ihr an der Reihe. Wo ist Atli Eiríksson?
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_catach|Ich war in Gleann Da Loch und habe das Buch 'The Cathach of Colum Cille.' an mich genommen. 
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_catach32|Ich fürchte, Gleann Da Loch ist zu weit entfernt. Würdet ihr stattdessen etwas Geld annehmen?
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_svenlair|Ihr wisst, wonach ich trachte. Wo ist das Versteck von Stiernacken Sven?
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_buy_ship|Ich möchte ein Schiff erwerben.
dlga_port_chief_buy_ship:close_window|Folge mir!
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_info_main|Ich habe einige Fragen bezüglich der Schiff- und Seefahrt.
dlga_port_chief_info_main:port_chief_info_main_1|Was wollt Ihr wissen?
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief_info_a_1|Warum gehen Menschen auf Seefahrt?
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief_info_b_1|Wie finde ich den richtigen Kurs?
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief_info_c_1|Was muss ich beachten, wenn ich ein Boot erwerben möchte?
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief_info_d_1|Was macht ein Boot schnell?
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief2|Das ist alles, was ich wissen wollte. Habt Dank!
dlga_port_chief_info_a_1:port_chief_info_main|Ihr könnt eine Menge Geld verdienen wenn Ihr Handel mit Waren oder Sklaven über das Meer betreibt. Andere verwenden es auch um Siedlungen zu Plündern. Schlussendlich wird Euch kein Wikinger als Anführer akzeptieren solange Ihr kein gutes Schiff besitzt. 
dlga_port_chief_info_b_1:port_chief_info_main|Betrachtet am Tage die Sonne und ruht Euch in der Nacht aus. Je besser Ihr es vermögt Euren Weg zu finden, um so schneller werdet Ihr Reisen.
dlga_port_chief_info_c_1:port_chief_info_c_2|Zunächst müsst ihr wissen, welche Art von Schiff ihr wollt. Wenn Handel eure Absicht ist, ist ein Knorr wohl eine gute Wahl. Viel Stauraum, aber nicht sehr schnell. Das Snekkja, das Skei und das Busse sind schnelle Kriegsschiffe und in der Lage viele Truppen zu befördern. Das Karvi ist etwas von allem. Wenn ihr nur wenige Männer habt, ist ein kleines Schiff wie das Byrding wahrscheinlich die beste Wahl.
dlga_port_chief_info_c_2:port_chief_info_main|Als zweites müsst ihr eine Holzsorte für euer Schiff wählen. Schiffe aus Eichenholz sind am zuverlässig und langlebig, aber sehr teuer. Buchenholz ist billiger, jedoch nicht so haltbar.
dlga_port_chief_info_d_1:port_chief_info_main|Der Wind -- Richte deine Segel gut aus um ihn am besten zu nutzen. Wenn kein Wind weht müssen deine Mannen rudern. Je mehr Ruderer, desto schneller ist das Schiff.  Solltet Ihr mehrere Schiffe in Eurer Flotte haben, so werdet Ihr nur so schnell sein wie Euer langsamstes Schiff. Ein fähiger Navigator ist in der Lager Eure Flotte schneller reisen zu lassen.
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_travel|Ich möchte zu einem anderen Hafen reisen.
dlga_port_chief_travel:close_window|Es tut mir Leid. Hier sind derzeit keine Schiffe, die eine ganze Armee und ihren Anführer aufnehmen können.
dlga_port_chief_travel:close_window.1|Es tut mir Leid. Hier sind derzeit keine Schiffe, die eure Gruppe und all eure Güter aufnehmen können.
dlga_port_chief_travel:port_chief_travel_2|Von hier kann man zu den Häfen vom Königreich der Friesen, Dänemark, Königreich  Northvegr und Englaland reisen. Wo möchtet ihr hin?
dlga_port_chief_travel:port_chief_travel_2.1|Von hier kann man zu den Häfen von Eriuland und Englaland reisen. Wo möchtet ihr hin?
dlga_port_chief_travel:close_window.2|Verzeiht. Derzeit befinden sich keine Passagierschiffe im Hafen.

dlga_port_chief_pick_up_ship2:port_chief_pick_up_ship3|Ja!
dlga_port_chief_pick_up_ship2:port_chief2|Nein, noch nicht.
dlga_port_chief_pick_up_ship3:port_chief2|Verzeiht, aber Eure Fähigkeit König der Meere, ist nicht hoch genug um ein weiteres Schiff Eurer Flotte in diesem Hafen hinzuzufügen.
dlga_port_chief_pick_up_ship3:close_window|Nun gut, seht es Euch an und gibt ihm einen Namen.
dlga_port_chief_pick_up_ship3:port_chief2.1|Für ein weiteres Boot gibt es im Hafen nicht mehr genügend Platz.
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_build_ship_main|Ich möchte, dass Ihr ein Schiff für mich anfertigt.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main:port_chief_build_ship_main_1|An welche Art von Schiff habt Ihr gedacht?
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_1:port_chief_build_ship_main_2|Ich brauch nur eine kleine Byrding ( leichtes Frachtschiff )
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_1:port_chief_build_ship_main_2.1|Ich benötige eine Knorr für den Handel.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_1:port_chief_build_ship_main_2.2|Ein gute Angriffs Snekkja ( Langschiff )!
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_1:port_chief_build_ship_main_2.3|Ich bin an einem doppelt so großem Kriegsschiff interessiert. Eine Skeid, bitte.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_1:port_chief_build_ship_main_2.4|Ich habe viele Krieger. Könntet ihr eine Busse für mich bauen.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_1:port_chief_build_ship_main_2.5|Ich benötige ein gutes vielseitiges Schiff. Ich möchte eine Karvi.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_1:port_chief2|Ich habe meine Meinung geändert.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_2:port_chief_build_ship_main|Verzeiht aber ich bin für solch einen Auftrag nicht talentiert genug. Allein die Skandinavier vermögen ein {s11} zu bauen.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_2:port_chief_info_main_3|Aus welchem Holz sollte es gefertigt werden?
dlga_port_chief_info_main_3:port_chief_build_ship_main_4|Eichenholz. Ich lege auf Qualität wert.
dlga_port_chief_info_main_3:port_chief_build_ship_main_4.1|Kiefer wäre schön.
dlga_port_chief_info_main_3:port_chief_build_ship_main_4.2|Ich möchte nicht so viel ausgeben. Eschenholz sollte genügen.
dlga_port_chief_info_main_3:port_chief2|Ich habe meine Meinung geändert.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_4:port_chief_build_ship_main_5|Für ein {s11} aus {s12} erbitte ich {reg11} Pfennige für meine Arbeit.\n{s2} Es wird {reg12} Tage dauern dieses Schiff zu bauen.

dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_5:port_chief_build_ship_missing_1|Ähm, sehe ich vielleicht wie ein Händler aus? Ich trage diese Dinge nicht bei mir.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_missing_1:port_chief2|verzeiht, aber ich kann Euer Schiff ohne diese Materialien nicht bauen. Kauft sie Euch und kehrt zurück sobald Ihr alles habt. 
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_5:port_chief_build_ship_missing_2|Ich habe derzeit nicht genug Pfennige.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_missing_2:port_chief2|Verzeiht, jedoch muss ich meine Familie ernähren und meine Arbeiter bezahlen. Kommt wieder sobald ihr das nötige Geld besitzt.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_5:port_chief_build_ship_missing_3|Ich werde dies noch einmal überdenken und später zurückkehren.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_missing_3:port_chief2|Nehmt die Zeit die Ihr braucht, aber vertraut mir. Meine Schiff sind jeden Penny wert.
dlga_port_chief_build_ship_main_6:port_chief2|Ausgezeichnet! Kehrt in {reg12} Tagen zurück.
dlga_port_chief3:close_window|Ich benötige zurzeit nichts. Gehabt Euch wohl.
dlga_port_chief_fleet1:port_chief_fleet2|{s2}^^Heill, {playername}. Wie ich sehe habt Ihr Euch einen Namen in diesen Ländern gemacht. Es macht mich Glücklich das mein Geschäft mit Euch geholfen hat. Dies verdient Anerkennung in einer Sage über Euch! Die Flotte von Sven und Harald liegt jenseits dieser Bucht. Sie ist fünfzig Schiffe stark und viele davon sind Kriegsschiffe, insgesamt über 800 Männer. Habt Ihr Eure Angelegenheiten in Dänemark geklärt? Seid Ihr bereit aufzubrechen? Ich versichere Euch, dass Ihr nicht mehr so schnell zurück kehren werdet!
dlga_port_chief_fleet2:the_fleetmt1|Ja ich bin mir sicher, lasset uns aufbrechen. Bemannt die Schiffe.
dlga_the_fleetmt1:close_window|Nun gut, viel Glück Vinr. Obgleich Ihr hier viele Schiffe erblickt, liegen die meisten der Schiffe jenseits der Bucht, außerhalb dieser Stadt, vor Anker. Schließt Euch ihr an sobald Ihr bereit seit.
dlga_port_chief_fleet2:port_chief2|Nein, ich muss noch einige Dinge erledigen. Ich komme wieder ...
dlga_port_chief_catach:port_chief_catach2|{s2}^^Nun gut, gebt mit dieses Buch und ich erzähle Euch wonach Ihr fragtet.
dlga_port_chief_catach2:port_chief_catach31|Hier, nehmt es. Nun, wo ist Svens Versteck?
dlga_port_chief_catach2:port_chief_catach32|Unglücklicherweise habe ich das Buch verloren. Würdet ihr stattdessen Geld nehmen ?
dlga_port_chief_catach32:port_chief_catach4|Mein Auftraggeber wird darüber nicht sehr erfreut sein und die Leute werden an Eurer Zuverlässigkeit zweifeln. Mein Auftraggeber hat mir 10,000 Pfennige für dieses Buch geboten. Habt Ihr soviel Geld in Eurem besitzt ?

dlga_port_chief_catach4:port_chief2|Unglücklicherweise, nein. Ich werde bald zurück sein, sobald ich es habe.
dlga_port_chief_catach5:port_chief_catach5_1|Oh, Ihr seit wahrhaftig ein{reg59?e reiche Frau: reicher Mann}! Das Versteck ist hier in Dänemark, südöstlich von Ribe, flussaufwärts. Far thu vel. ( Gehabt Euch wohl )

dlga_port_chief_catach31_1:port_chief2|Habt Dank.
dlga_port_chief_svenlair:port_chief_svenlair2|{s2}^^Warum den so laut mein Freund? Niemand hier am Hafen muss erfahren über was wir sprechen. Ich sehe jemand hat Euch von mir erzählt. Großartig. So funktioniert das Geschäft.^^ Nun gut, Ihr wollt den Ort erfahren. Es ist nicht schwer es in Erfahrung zu bringen jedoch hat es seinen Preis, versteht sich. Bull Neck Sven ist ein gefährlicher Mann.
dlga_port_chief_svenlair2:port_chief_svenlair3|{s2}^^Hört gut zu. Glücklicherweise brauche ich genau jemanden wie Euch. Ich brauche Euch gewissermaßen als Räuber und Ihr müsst nach Eriuland reisen. Mein Auftraggeber wünscht ein gewisses Buch, welches sich derzeit im Besitz eines Klosters, als eine Art Relikt, befindet. Das Kloster trägt den Namen Gleann Da Loch. Der Name des Buches lautet 'The Cathach of Colum Cille.' Ich bin lediglich an dem Buch interessiert. Alles andere könnt Ihr Euch zu eigen machen. Bringt mir dieses Buch und Ihr werdet erfahren wo sich Sven Bull Neck versteck. 
dlga_port_chief_svenlair3:port_chief_svenlair31|Hört sich gut an! Ich werde euch dieses Buch bringen. Wir sehen uns bald wieder.
dlga_port_chief_svenlair3:port_chief_svenlair32|Ich werde weder ein Kloster Plündern noch einen Mönch töten.
dlga_port_chief_svenlair3:port_chief_svenlair33|Ich bevorzuge es dieses Buch zu vergessen und euch stattdessen Pfennige für die Informationen zu bieten.
dlga_port_chief_svenlair31:close_window|Gut, ich werde da sein. Ich schlage vor, Sie reparieren und Ihr Schiffund stellen es bereit. Die Reise nach Eriuland ist lang. Und bringen Sie genügend Männer für den Eriu Krieg. Far thu vel.
dlga_port_chief_svenlair32:close_window|Dann kauft das Buch! Es ist mir gleich, wie ihr daran kommt. Bringt es mir nur. Und ich schlage vor, ihr repariert und versorgt euer Schiff. Die Reise nach Eriuland ist lang. Und bringt genug Männer heran.
dlga_port_chief_svenlair33:port_chief_svenlair4|Nun gut ist dies eine Option?  Mein Auftraggeber hat mir 10,000 Pfennige für dieses Buch geboten. Habt Ihr soviel Geld in Eurem besitzt ?
dlga_port_chief_svenlair4:port_chief_svenlair5|Ich habe das Geld. Hier nehmt es und erzählt mir wo sich Sven aufhält.
dlga_port_chief_svenlair4:port_chief_svenlair31|Unglücklicherweise besitze ich nicht soviel Geld. Ich werde Euch diese Buch bringen. Auf bald! 
dlga_port_chief_svenlair5:port_chief_svenlair5_1|Oh, Ihr seit wahrhaftig reich! Das Versteck ist hier in Dänemark, südöstlich von Ribe, flussaufwärts. Far thu vel. ( Gehabt Euch wohl )
dlga_port_chief_svenlair5_1:port_chief2|Habt Dank.
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter1:port_chief_bodoletter2|{s2}^^Warum sprecht Ihr den immer so laut? Nun gut, Ihr kennt mich und ich bin stets eine gute Quelle für Informationen, jedoch hat alles seinen Preis.
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter2:port_chief_bodoletter3|{s2}^^Hört gut zu. Diese Information ist äußerst wertvoll. Wir sprechen hier über den 2 wichtigsten Mann Dänemarks, Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye.' Wie wäre es mit 12,000 Pfennige? Besitzt Ihr soviel Geld? Wenn nicht, könntet Ihr mir stattessen eine kleinen Gefallen tun. Ich habe einen Kunden, welcher einige Pelze nach Dubh Linn in Eriuland überbringen muss. Also warum entscheidet Ihr Euch nicht die Pelze für mich zu überbringen? Im Gegenzug werde ich Euch die Informationen geben. 
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter3:port_chief_bodoletter_pieles|Gut, abgemacht. Ich werde Euch die Felle besorgen.
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter3:port_chief_bodoletter4|Ach ja, hier habe ich das Geld. Nehmt es. Wo ist er nun?
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter3:port_chief_bodoletter7|Aber wir sind doch alte Freunde. Ihr werdet wohl für einen alten Geschäftspartner einen Nachlass haben?
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter3:port_chief_bodoletter3_1|Leider nein. Ich werde bald mit der nötigen Summe zurückkommen.
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter_pieles:close_window|Erfreulich dies zu hören. Geht nach Dubh Linn und liefert die pelze an einen Mann Namens Hogni. Er ist der örtliche Händler. Ihr werdet ihn leicht finden. Ich empfehle Euch noch andere Güter mit Euch zu tragen um sie in diesen entfernten Länder zu verkaufen. Sobald Ihr mit dem Rezept zurück kehrt, werdet Ihr die Informationen erhalten.
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter3_1:port_chief2|Dann kommt wieder sobald Ihr das Geld habt, ich habe keine Zeit für Bettler.
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter4:port_chief_bodoletter5|Seid Ihr denn nicht ein reicher Mann! Nun gut, Atli Eiriksson hält sich in Northvegr auf. Jedenfalls, hat dies einer seiner Männer einer der Dirnen hier erzählt. Offenbar trägt Atli etwas von großer Bedeutung mit sich, was unter allen umständen geheim bleiben muss... erst mal. Er versteckt sich in einer Höhle an der nördlichen Küste von Northvegr, nahe Hordaland. Far thu vel.
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter5:port_chief2|Habt Dank.
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter7:port_chief_bodoletter8|Hmm... nun ja, nur dieses eine Mal, aber sagt es niemanden! ich habe meinen Ruf zu verlieren. Achttausend Pfennige, und ich verrate Euch, was Ihr wissen wollt. Habt Ihr das Geld?
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter8:port_chief_bodoletter9|Sicher. Hier nehmt es. Wo ist er?
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter8:port_chief_bodoletter3_1|Leider nein. Ich werde bald mit der nötigen Summe zurückkommen.
dlga_port_chief_bodoletter9:port_chief_bodoletter5|Nun gut, bedenkt aber dass es keine weitere Rabatte geben wird. Atli Eiriksson hält sich in Northvegr auf. Jedenfalls hat einer seiner Männer, dies einer der Dirnen hier erzählt. Offenbar trägt Atli was wertvolles mit sich, was unter allen umständen geheim bleiben muss... zurzeit zumindest. Er versteckt sich in einer Höhle , an der nördlichen Küste von Northvegr, nahe Hordaland. Far thu vel.
dlga_port_chief_pieles:port_chief_bodoletter5|Ich mag es mit Euch Geschäfte zu machen. Nun gut, Atli Eiriksson hält sich in Northvegr auf.

dlga_the_fleetcrew1:close_window|Mir wurde gesagt, es ist Wochen, sogar Monate aus, viel Glück also. Ihre Flotte wartet am Ende des Hafens auf Sie. Nehmen Sie Ihr Boot und folgen Sie ihnen.

dlga_port_r_2:close_window|Ich möchte gehen. Gehabt Euch wohl.
dlga_start:close_window.5|Warum stört Ihr mich? Ich bin beschäftigt. Ich habe keine Zeit für Leute wie Euch. Kommt an einem anderen Tag wieder. Oder noch besser, gar nicht mehr.^^-- Es scheint als wäre Sigurd nicht gewillt Euch zu empfangen. Ihr müsst nach einem anderen Weg suchen um an Informationen über Sven zu gelangen.
dlga_start:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot|Dies ist ein guter Platzt, weit weg von neugierigen Ohren. Nun sprecht.

Jedoch glaube ich habt Ihr mehr Interesse an dem Aufenthaltsort von Sven Bull Neck, habe ich recht? Nun, er entkam, jedoch nicht weit. Er hat Readingum erobert und es zu einer Festung gemacht, jedoch sind ihm meine Männer gefolgt. Ich habe einen Herse in mein Vertrauen gezogen, Arnvid, und die Mission in seine Obhut übertragen.

dlga_conversation_companioncamp:beda_conversationcamp1|Mein {reg59?lady:lord}, manchmal denke ich, als wir entlang der nördlichen Länder reisten, was eine düstere Welt in der wir leben, ich habe viele Bücher gelesen, aber keiner von ihnen spricht über die Gewalt und viele Gefahren, die wir täglich durchgehen.
dlga_beda_conversationcamp1:beda_conversationcamp2|Nun, denke ich, die Dänen sind die Horden von Gog und Magog, sie werden in der letzten Stunde der Menscheheit da sein und das Königreich West Seaxe ist das letzte menschliche Königreich, das versucht, das unvermeidliche vor dem zweiten Kommen zu bekämpfen.
dlga_beda_conversationcamp2:beda_conversationcamp3|Ähm..könnt Ihr das mit Gog und Magog noch mal wiederholen?
dlga_beda_conversationcamp2:close_window|Sehr interessant, aber ich habe keine Zeit für diesen Augenblick.
dlga_beda_conversationcamp3:beda_conversationcamp4|Oh, natürlich. Die Bibel erwähnt Gog als den Anführer der vom Reich von Magog im hohen Norden kommenden Horden. Laut Ezekiels Prophezeihung, führt Gog eine fürchterliche Armee von durchtrainierten Kriegern von verschiedensten Ländern. Sie werden ein von Gott gewähltes Reich angreifen, was zu einem Krieg führen wird, der die ganze Welt erschüttert. Ich denke dies beginnt bereits durch den Austieg der Heiden in Englaland.

dlga_conversation_companioncamp:egil_conversationcamp1|{playername}, ich mag Euch, aber manchmal denke ich Ihr seid zu naiv als Anführer. Erlaubt mir Euch einen Rat zu geben.
dlga_egil_conversationcamp1:egil_conversationcamp2|Ich will dich nicht beleidigen, aber ich denke Ihr solltet meine Erfahrung nutzen. Wie Ihr wisst bin ich am Hofe des Königs aufgewachsen. Ich habe viel Zeit in Ribe verbracht, wo ich die größten Kriegsherren und Kommandanten getroffen habe.
dlga_egil_conversationcamp2:egil_conversationcamp3|{s10}
dlga_egil_conversationcamp2:close_window|Ich brauch Eure Lehren nicht.
dlga_egil_conversationcamp3:close_window|{s4}
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:donnachdh_conversationcamp1|Grüße Kriegsherr, Ihr solltet wissen, dass ich von Eriu komme und direkt von den alten Kriegern abstamme. Selbst meine Mutter war vom alten Clan, welcher dem Helden Cu Chulainn gehörte.
dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp1:donnachdh_conversationcamp2|Eriu gliedert sich in kleine Clans, manche mehr manche weniger mächtig. Vereint bilden sie Königreiche, seit einer halben Ewigkeit genau fünf an der Zahl, des Öfteren führen sie kleine Kriege gegeneinander. Meistens bekriegen wir Nachbarclans, wenn Rivalitäten sich zuspitzen, jedoch vielfach größere Clans führen andere in Kriege zwischen den Königreichen, denn die wichtigsten Männer der Insel trachten nach dem Throne von Tara. Der Meister von Tara zu sein bedeutet der höchste König aller Eriu, bedeutet der Ard Ruire zu sein. Dies ist die größte Ehre, die eine Mann seinem Clan bringen kann.
dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp2:donnachdh_conversationcamp3|So viele Streitigkeiten machen die Dinge einfach für die Vikinger.
dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp2:donnachdh_conversationcamp3_2|Diese ganzen Kriege bringen nur harte Krieger hervor.
dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp2:donnachdh_conversationcamp3_3|Irgendjemand sollte all diese Clans vereinen.
dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp2:close_window|Dies interessiert mich äußerst wenig.
dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp3:donnachdh_conversationcamp4|Ich gebe zu, einige Wikinger wurden stark in so manchem Gebiet der Insel, jedoch sind sie so gespalten, wie wir es sind. Tatsächlich wage ich zu behaupten, sie sind bereits Teil von Eriu. Es ist keine Seltenheit, Wikinger Seite an Seite mit Goidels gegen andere Wikinger kämpfen zu sehen. Die Könige von Eriu heuren sie als Söldner an und oftmals dienen sie feindseligen Clans die sich gegenüberstehen.
dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp3_2:donnachdh_conversationcamp4|Ja das stimmt. Krieg vernichtet die Schwachen und zwingt Männer den Kampf zu erlernen. Gewiss ist es nun günstig, Krieger für Eure Arme zu erlangen.  Auf der anderen Seite, lässt Ihr euch in die Goidelische Politik ein or versucht Ihr gar König von Tara zu werden, werdet Ihr merken, dass die Insel ihre politischen Traditionen hat und nichts was auch immer Ihr tut wird Eriu je verändern können.
dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp3_3:donnachdh_conversationcamp4|Alle Männer und Clans begehren den Throne von Tara, jedoch kaum einer ist ihm würdig. Jene, die es versuchen haben meist ein kurzes Leben und bald steigt ein Neuer empor mitsamt seinem Clan. Sollte er Thron von Tara je Euer sein, möget Ihr ihn so lange wie möglich geniessen. Euer Clan wird berühmt und geehrt werden, Euer Leben jedoch - von kurzer Dauer.
dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp4:close_window|Mit Sicherheit ist Eriu, oder Hibernia, wi die alten Römer es nannten, ist ein anderes Land. Vergesst alles was Ihr darüber wisst, Eriu ist anders.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:donnachdh_dwywei_conv1|Jedes Mal, wenn ich ein Befehl in eurem Namen gebe, untergräbt Dwywei meine Autorität vor den Männern. Auch jetzt versammelt sie einige Krieger um über mich zu tuscheln. Ich verstehe einfach diesen Hass nicht, da wir beide aus dem selben Königreich stammen.
dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv1:donnachdh_dwywei_conv2|Das Scots Dal Riata sind blutige Verräter. Sie kamen von Eriu, unserer westlichen Länder zu nehmen. Vor einigen Jahren haben wir unseren geliebten König Land verloren Kampf gegen die Normannen und die meisten der Piktischen Adligen starb mit ihm. Cinaed Mac Ailpin, König von Dal Riata, bestritten dann die Pikten Krone mit den Überlebenden Mitgliedern der sieben königlichen Häuser der Pikten.
dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv2:donnachdh_dwywei_conv3|--sie grits die Zähnen--^ ^ Cinaed uns in Schlacht geschlagen und später trafen sich alle Geschädigten die Pikten Krone in Scone. Sie beim met gezecht und Ale floss frei. Was dann geschah ist bekannt als Mac Ailpin Verrat: "der Eroberer" alle unsere Adligen getötet und wurde der einzige Kläger für die Pikten Krone. Nun sein Nachfolger, König von Alban, Regeln über die Pikten und die Schotten. Wer diese Verräter Rennen vertrauen können? Mich? Nein!
dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv3:donnachdh_dwywei_conv4|Blöde und sture Pikten...
dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv4:donnachdh_dwywei_conv5|Vergesst die alte Feindschaft. Wir haben jetzt einen gemeinsamen Feind. Wir müssen nun zusammen gegen die Nordmannen kämpfen.
dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv4:donnachdh_dwywei_conv6|Ich verstehe Eure Bedenken gegenüber den Schotten, aber Donnachdh hat seine Ehre schon bewiesen.
dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv4:donnachdh_dwywei_conv7|Sind die Schotten so? Dann hasse ich sie auch, verdammte Betrüger!
dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv5:close_window|Wie Ihr wollt.
dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv6:close_window|Ich verstehe, dass Donnachdh nicht daran schuld ist. Ich werde versuchen von nun an netter zu ihm zu sein.
dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv7:close_window|Ich hoffe, um Euer WIllen, dass Ihr scherzt, denn ich finde dies nicht so witzig.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:morgant_conversationcamp1|{reg59?My lady:Sir}, in Curnubia hartgesottene Männer sind eine aussterbende Rasse. In der Vergangenheit waren wir ein stolzes Volk und unsere Ländereien erstreckten sich über den Süden Britanniens. Dann kamen die Sachsen und wir verloren unser Land.
dlga_morgant_conversationcamp1:morgant_conversationcamp2|Jetzt bringt die See die Dänen, zuvor die Angeln und Sachsen. Nun fürchten die Sachsen, dass die Dänen ihnen das Land wegnehmen, welc´hes sie einst uns entrissen. Ist das Schicksal nicht ironisch?
dlga_morgant_conversationcamp2:morgant_conversationcamp3|Sicher, aber ich sorge mich nicht um die Sachsen. Sie werden verlieren was sie gestolen haben.
dlga_morgant_conversationcamp2:morgant_conversationcamp3_2|Die Sachsen sind stark. Sie werden den Dänen standhalten.
dlga_morgant_conversationcamp2:close_window|Ich habe sehr wenig Interesse hierfür.
dlga_morgant_conversationcamp3:morgant_conversationcamp4|Es ist möglich. Vielleicht hat Gott einen Sinn für Humor, oder unsere Gebete brachten die Dänen, um die Sachsen zu bestrafen. Aber wen interessiert das schon? Britannien ist für uns Britannier verloren .
dlga_morgant_conversationcamp3_2:morgant_conversationcamp4|Ihr denkt unsere Männer sind schwach? Ich denke nicht! Es ist war, dass wir unvereint und unglücklich mit unserem König waren, aber Arthur zeigte uns, dass es möglich sei, die Sachsen zu besiegen. Wir können nur bereuen, dass es niemanden gab, der sein Vermächtnis antreten konnte. Britannien ist nun für uns verloren.
dlga_morgant_conversationcamp4:morgant_conversationcamp5|Britannien wird den Britanniern zurückgegeben werden. Ich schwöre, ich werde das tun.
dlga_morgant_conversationcamp4:morgant_conversationcamp5_1|Vergesst die Vergangenheit und konzentriert euch auf die Gegenwart. 
dlga_morgant_conversationcamp5:close_window|Ich schätze deine Worte, aber wir beide wissen, dass, selbst wenn Sie die ganze Insel erobern, Britannia wird von heute nichts gemeinsam haben mit Britannia von Yore. Es werden nicht die gleichen mehr sein.
dlga_morgant_conversationcamp5_1:close_window|Ja, Ihr habt Recht. Es macht nicht viel Sinn der Vergangenheit nachzutrauern. Lasst uns zur Gegenwart zurückkehren.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:dwywei_conversationcamp1|{Playername}, meine Eltern waren wichtige Leute in Pictland, ihre Großeltern und alle meine Vorfahren. Sie waren Nachkommen von der mütterlichen Seite der Pikten wichtige Personen von königlichem Blut.
dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp1:dwywei_conversationcamp2|Jedoch gab es viele Veränderungen im Königreich bekannt als Alban. Unsere Mitarbeiter sind mit unseren alten Feinden, den Goidels Dal Riata, mischen und meine Familie war blamiert. Ich habe versucht, unsere Exclusive als Krieger zu erholen, aber da die Pikten Christ umarmte, Frauen ausgeschlossen wurden aus diesem Beruf mehr und mehr jeden Tag. Letztendlich konnte ich und meine Familie für mein Versagen mit ihrem Leben bezahlt.
dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp2:dwywei_conversationcamp3|Ich normalerweise nicht über das reden, aber ich möchte sagen, dass ich eine neue Familie gefunden haben, während der Reise mit Ihnen. Dies hilft mir, die Belastung aus meiner Vergangenheit. Jahrelang hasste ich die aktuellen Könige von Alban. Nun interessieren ich nicht mehr. Mein Versagen und die neuen Gesetze unseres Landes, die über das Ende meiner Familie gebracht. Ich bete nur, dass Sie mich hart für meine Vergangenheit verurteilen nicht.
dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp3:dwywei_conversationcamp4|Was geschah leigt in der Vergangenheit. Sie sind sehr wichtig für mich.
dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp3:dwywei_conversationcamp4_2|Vielen Dank, dass Sie Ihre Geschichte mit mir teilen. Ich bin froh, dass Sie Frieden mit sich selbst geschlossen haben.
dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp3:close_window|Sie haben den Tod Ihrer Familie herbeigeführt, und Sie wollen nicht zu streng verurteilt werden? Unsinn!
dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp4:close_window|--Sie sieht schütern zum Boden--^^Ihr seid sehr wichtig für mich. Oh, nun, ich habe noch etwas zu erledigen.
dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp4_2:close_window|Vielen Dank für Ihr Verständnis.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:dwyweiromance_conversationcamp1|{Playername}, obwohl Sie mich hart in Schlachten kämpfen sehen, meinen Körper mit Krieg überzogen zu markieren, und schreien, während ich unsere Feinde stechen...
dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp1:dwyweiromance_conversationcamp3|Sie wissen, dass ich ein schüchterner Mensch bin, richtig?
dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp3:dwyweiromance_conversationcamp4|Ich wusste das nicht.
dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp3:dwyweiromance_conversationcamp4_2|Ja, ich weiß.
dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp3:close_window|Ich habe gerade wenig Zeit mir etwas diesbezüglich anzuhören. Wir reden später.
dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp4:close_window|Oh, ich verstehe. Nun denn, ich... wir werden an einem anderen Tag reden...
dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp4_2:close_window|Was ich meine ist, dass ich kann Dinge sagen, aber ich Sie wissen möchte, dass ich bewundere und schätze Sie sehr. Nun, will ich nicht mehr darüber reden. Es ist umständlich. Wir reden noch einen Tag.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp1|Ich muss mit Euch sprechen {playername}. Es ist mir erst, aber ich werde es nur ein einziges Mal erwähnen.
dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp1:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp3|Ich bin an Euch interessiert, weiß Euch zu schätzen und mag Euch. Ich denke Ihr fühlt genauso, wenn ich sehe, wie Ihr mich immer anseht, aber ich bin mir nicht sicher. Kann es sein...?
dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp3:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp4|Ja, Dwywei, ich mag Sie sehr.
dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp3:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp4_2|Tut mir leid, aber ich bin nicht an Ihnen interessiert.
dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp4:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp5|Ich freue mich zu hören, dass Sie das sagen! Ich denke, das bedeutet, dass wir jetzt zusammen sind, richtig?
dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp4_2:close_window|Tut mir leid, tut mir leid, ich fühle mich verlegen. Ich dachte... Ich habe mich geirrt. Tut mir leid, ich werde Sie jetzt nicht mehr stören. Ich habe noch Dinge zu erledigen.
dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp5:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp6|Ja, Dwywei, bist du jetzt meine Frau.
dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp5:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp7|Nein. Es war nur ein Witz. Ich bin überhaupt nicht an Ihnen interessiert.
dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp6:close_window|Ich bin so glücklich! Ich liebe dich. Ich werde meine Sachen in Euer Zelt bringen!
dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp7:close_window|Ein Witz? Du bist ein Idiot! Welche Art Mensch scherzt denn über solche Dinge? Lass mich in Ruhe. Ich will Sie nicht mehr wieder sehen.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:reginhard1_conversationcamp1|Mein Freund, einige Eurer Männer klagen wegen des schlechten Essens. Wollt Iht ihre Namen wissen?
dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp1:reginhard1_conversationcamp2|Ich bin dankbar für Eure Sorge, Reginhard.
dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp2:reginhard1_conversationcamp3|Nun gut, err... I weiß Ihr seid ein großzügiger Mann. Ich mir sicher Ihr werdet meine Treue schon irgentwie entlohnen... Ihr wisst was ich meine nehme ich an.
dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp3:close_window|Sicher. Nehmt dieses Geld und informiert mich.
dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp3:close_window.1|Haltet euer gieriges Maul, Abschaum. Versucht nicht mich zu betrügen.  
dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp3:close_window.2|Ich zahle jedem Mann, was er verdient. Vergesst das nicht.
dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp3:close_window.3|Es wird nicht notwendig sein. Am morgigen Tag wird das Essen besser sein.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:clovis1_conversationcamp1|Kriegsherr, ich denke es ist notwendig Eure Männer besser zu trainieren. Habt Ihr schon von Vegetius gehör? Die Vorfahren wussten wie man aus einfachen Bauern große Soldaten in nur ein paar Tagen machte.
dlga_clovis1_conversationcamp1:clovis1_conversationcamp2|Ich kann sie zwingen härter zu trainieren. Glaubt mit. Ihr werdet sehen wie ich sie zu Veteranen mache.
dlga_clovis1_conversationcamp2:close_window|Nun gut, lasst sie schwitzen., aber ich will gute Resultate sehen. Nehmt diese 1000 Pfennige um die besten zu belohnen.
dlga_clovis1_conversationcamp2:close_window.1|Das ist ein guter Einfall. Ich ernenne Euch zum Waffenmeister.
dlga_clovis1_conversationcamp2:close_window.2|Sie sind müde; Ich will sie nicht zwingen... noch nicht. Aber ich schätze Euer Angebot.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:ceawlin1_conversationcamp1|Ich möchte Euch etwas wichtiges sagen. Ein Kriegstrupp muss von einem Mann mit Ehre angeführt werden, aber diese Zeiten sind zu hart für Erbarmen. Die Krieger brauchen einen starken Anführer, jemanden derschwere Entscheidungen trifft wenn es dazu kommt.
dlga_ceawlin1_conversationcamp1:ceawlin1_conversationcamp2|--Sie bemerken, dass ein paar Eurer Männer Euer Gespräch mithören--^^Nur ein Dummkopf kann Erbarmen als Schwäche bezeichnen.
dlga_ceawlin1_conversationcamp2:ceawlin1_conversationcamp3|Nur so, aber Furcht lässt aus Männern Idioten werden. Seid nicht schwach {playername}. Sie können Angst wie Hunde riechen.
dlga_ceawlin1_conversationcamp3:close_window|Ich bin dankbar für Eure Sorge, aber ich weiß, wie ich mit meinen Leuten umzugehen habe.
dlga_ceawlin1_conversationcamp3:close_window.1|Vielleicht habt Ihr recht mein Freund. Ich werde Eurem Rat folgen.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:ailchu1_conversationcamp1|Ich habe meine Meinung bezüglich Brunhild geändert. Vielleicht eignet sie sich doch zu einem guten Krieger. Wollt Ihr wissen warum?
dlga_ailchu1_conversationcamp1:ailchu1_conversationcamp2|Ich höre.
dlga_ailchu1_conversationcamp2:ailchu1_conversationcamp3|Weil sie eine Woche lang blutete und nicht starb! Ha, ha, ha... Im Ernst, ist sie hier wirklich notwendig? Ihr ständiges tratschen bereitet mir Kopfschmerzen.
dlga_ailchu1_conversationcamp3:close_window|Im Ernst, Sie bereiten mir Kopfschmerzen. Noch behalte ich Sie...
dlga_ailchu1_conversationcamp3:close_window.1|Wenn Sie hier nicht sein wollen, sind Sie frei zu gehen.
dlga_ailchu1_conversationcamp3:close_window.2|Vielleicht ist eine Kriegstruppe kein guter Ort für sie. Ich werde darüber nachdenken.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:caio_conversationcamp1|Durch Eure Armee habe ich viele Orte besucht und Leute getroffen. Ich wusste gar nicht, dass die Welt so groß ist!
dlga_caio_conversationcamp1:caio_conversationcamp2|Erhlich, ich und meine Familie lebten die ganze Zeit in einer Höhle und gingen nur bis zum Wall, um Güter zu verkaufen. Einmal habe ich Bebbanburh besucht und dachte es der größte und schönste Ort der Welt. Das war nichts im Vergleich zu den Orten, an die Ihr mich bringt.
dlga_caio_conversationcamp2:caio_conversationcamp3|Und es gibt noch viele weitere Orte, die Ihr besuchen könnt.
dlga_caio_conversationcamp2:caio_conversationcamp4|Wieso quält Ihr mich damit?
dlga_caio_conversationcamp3:close_window|Ich weiß, dass es noch viele Orte zu sehen gibt. Ich wollte nur sagen, dass Euch beizutreten die beste Entscheidung meines Lebens war. Ich werde nie wieder zur Höhle meiner Eltern zurückkehren.
dlga_caio_conversationcamp4:close_window|Ah, tut mir leid. Ich verstehe, dass das für jemanden wie Euch ganz normal ist, aber für mich ist das ganz neu. Ich will Euch mit meinem Geschwätz nicht länger belästigen. Gehabt Euch wohl.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:caio_morgant_conv1|Ich will Euch etwas fragen über...
dlga_caio_morgant_conv1:caio_morgant_conv2|Caio ist der dümmste Mann, der mir je begegnet ist. Er fragt mich immer nach den einfachsten Dingen. Er weiß nichts über Taktik und seine Ignoranz bringt uns immer wieder in Gefahr.
dlga_caio_morgant_conv2:caio_morgant_conv3|Entschuldigt, falls ich Euch verärgert haben sollte. Ich wollte nur wissen was ein Cuenus ist.
dlga_caio_morgant_conv3:caio_morgant_conv4|--Er wird immer boshafter und spricht immer lauter--^^Wisst Ihr das nicht?
dlga_caio_morgant_conv4:caio_morgant_conv5|Ihr müsst mit Caio Geduld haben. Er ist ein wertvolles Mitglied und lernt schnell.
dlga_caio_morgant_conv4:caio_morgant_conv6|Caio, wenn Ihr nicht schnell auf Trab kommt, solltet Ihr vielleicht erwägen uns zu verlassen.
dlga_caio_morgant_conv4:close_window|Nerven Sie mich dieser Blödheit nicht noch einmal.
dlga_caio_morgant_conv5:close_window|Danke für Ihre Zuversicht.
dlga_caio_morgant_conv6:close_window|Ich... verstehe.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:brunhild_conversationcamp1|Manchmal wenn ich schlafe, träume ich von meinem früheren Leben in Doccinga und Kennemer. Diese Albträume erinnern mich an meine Zeit als Dienerin.
dlga_brunhild_conversationcamp1:brunhild_conversationcamp2|Ich bin froh, das ich alles, was hinter sich gelassen haben. In der Tat ich hasse Friese, und treten den Boden bringt dunkle Erinnerungen. Wenn wir auf unseren Reisen Friese besuchen, Frage ich nur Geduld mit mir haben. Ich werde die meiste Zeit in meinem Zelt verbringen, wenn wir nicht zu Fuß oder kämpfen, schmollen und wollte nicht mit niemandem reden.
dlga_brunhild_conversationcamp2:close_window|Nun, Verzeih mir, aber nur darüber zu reden bereitet mir Bauchschmerzen. Ich denke, dass diese Erinnerungen mich depremieren, Das kann nie verheilen sowas.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:bodo_conversationcamp1|--Beachten Sie, dass er ungeduldig, nervös ist.--^ ^ Hi {Playername}. Wir waren schon gemeinsam Reisende für eine Weile und unsere Freundschaft, zumindest für mich, ist ehrlich. In der Tat habe ich niemanden vertraut in letzter Zeit.
dlga_bodo_conversationcamp1:bodo_conversationcamp2|Eigentlich bin ich überrascht, dass unsere Beziehung so gut ist. Mein Leben ist nicht leicht gewesen, vor allem hier im Norden, und ich finde es schwer Menschen zu vertrauen, aber sie vertrauen mir zu einfach, es macht mir Angst.
dlga_bodo_conversationcamp2:bodo_conversationcamp3|Es ist gut anderen zu vertrauen, Bodo.
dlga_bodo_conversationcamp2:bodo_conversationcamp3_2|Genau das ist mir auch passiert.
dlga_bodo_conversationcamp2:bodo_conversationcamp4|Halten Sie Abstand. Sie sind nur ein Soldat für mich.
dlga_bodo_conversationcamp3:close_window|Ja, Ihr habt Recht. Ich sollte mehr Selbstvertrauen haben. Freundschaft ist normal, keine Klotz am Bein. Danke mein Freund!
dlga_bodo_conversationcamp3_2:close_window|Ihr fühlt es auch? Sehen Sie? Wir sind argwöhnische Leute, zu sehr daran gewöhnt in Gefahr zu sein und betrogen zu werden. Ich werde darüber nachdenken! Danke für Ihre Zeit.
dlga_bodo_conversationcamp4:close_window|Ja, tut mir leid. Ich war verwirrt, aber Ihr habt einiges deutlich gemacht.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:bodo_2conversationcamp1|{playername}, ich muss mit Euch reden! Es ist kompliziert. Ich weiß nicht wie ich es sagen soll, aber es muss gesagt werden.
dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp1:bodo_2conversationcamp2|Lasst mich das klar stellen, ich habe bemerkt, wie Ihr mich anseht und fürchte, dass Ihr Euch in mich verliebt. Ich verstehe das total. Ich bin ein attraktiver Mann mit Fertigkeiten eines Kämpfers und Anführers, aber ich muss Euch warnen, dass ich verheiratet bin. Ich habe eine Frau in Cantabria mit sechzehn Kindern.
dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp2:bodo_2conversationcamp3|Ich denke Ihr solltet damit aufhören, mit Pilzen zu experimentieren, Bod. Ich bin nicht an Euch interessiert.
dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp2:bodo_2conversationcamp3_2|Es stimmt. Ich mag Euch wirklich.
dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp2:bodo_2conversationcamp4|Haltet Abstand, Sir. SIe sind nur ein einfacher Soldat! Ich haben Euch kaum wahrgenommen.
dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp3:close_window|Seid Ihr sicher? Das überrascht mich, ehrlich Ihr Macho, der so viele Frauen anzieht. Nun, glücklicherweise kann ich nun wieder leichter atmen.
dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp3_2:bodo_2conversationcamp5|Das beunruhigt mich. Ihr seid eine attraktive Frau, aber Ihr müsst wissen, dass ich ein verheirateter Mann bin und es meiner Frau schulde. Ich muss klar stellen, dass nie etwas zwischen uns sein wird.
dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp4:close_window|Ja, tut mir leid. Ich war verwirrt, aber Ihr habt einiges deutlich gemacht.
dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp5:close_window|Ich habe bloß gescherzt. Ich mag Euch eigentlich gar nicht. Ihr seid ein hässliches Schwein.
dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp5:close_window.1|Macht Euch keine Sorgen. Von nun an ist unsere Beziehung nur noch die zwischen Krieger und Kriegsherren.
dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp5:close_window.2|Kein Problem, aber ich werde Euren Name auf meiner Wunschliste lassen.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:solveig_conversationcamp1|Zum ersten mal in meinem Leben habe ich das Gefühl ich bin in einer richtigen Armee. Ein Krieger zu sein ist schön von ein Teiler einer Großen Armee, aber hier wissen Sie, wie Aufrecht und Ordnung ist und sie Respektieren mich
dlga_solveig_conversationcamp1:solveig_conversationcamp2|Die Dänen und Norweger und die Welt im Allgemeinen, haben keine gute Meinung von einer Frau, die ihr Zuhause bewaffnet und bereit zu kämpfen verlässt. Genau aus diesem Grund sind die Skjalmo mehr Legende als die Realität. Es gibt sehr wenige wie mich, und bald wir es niemanden mehr geben, der mir glauben wird.
dlga_solveig_conversationcamp2:solveig_conversationcamp3|In meiner Armee unterscheiden wir nicht zwischen Mann und Frau, wir unterscheiden nur zwischen guten und schlechten Kriegern.
dlga_solveig_conversationcamp2:solveig_conversationcamp3_2|Ihr werdet hier immer gut behandelt werden.
dlga_solveig_conversationcamp2:solveig_conversationcamp4|Frau, Euer Platz wird immer zu Hause bei Eurem Mann sein.
dlga_solveig_conversationcamp3:close_window|Ich weiß, und mag es hier. Ihr müsst wissen, dass ich Euch ein loyaler Begleiter sein werde. Ich habe mich Eurer Sache verschrieben.
dlga_solveig_conversationcamp3_2:close_window|Danke {playername}. Ich hoffe Ihr werdet noch lange Zeit an meiner Seite bleiben.
dlga_solveig_conversationcamp4:close_window|Ich bin verwirrt. Einerseits akzeptiert Ihr mich in Eurer Armee, aber andererseits sagt Ihr, ich solle heirateten und nach Hause zurückkehren. Ihr müsst scherzen. Hah! Gut einen auf die alte Solveig.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:solveig_2conversationcamp1|ich mag Euch wirklich sehr {playername}. Ich muss zugeben, dass ich mich Euch hingezogen fühle.
dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp1:solveig_2conversationcamp2|Wie du weißt, wählte ich den Weg des Krieges. Ich halte meine Jungfräulichkeit , um mich vor der Liebe und Männern zu schützen. Es gibt keinen anderen Weg; es ist nicht die bequemste Art und Weise, aber es hat seine Gesetze, und wenn ich diese breche, wird mein Leben sinnlos sein. Meine Arme sind meine einzigen Männer, und mein Schild ist mein Zuhause. Ich möchte das du das respektierst, oder ich werde deine  Truppe verlassen.
dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp2:solveig_2conversationcamp3|Ich respektiere das Solveig, und ich fühle mich Euch nicht wirklich hingezogen.
dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp2:solveig_2conversationcamp4|Es tut mir leid Solveig, aber ich habe mich in Euch verliebt.
dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp3:close_window|Nun, ein Teil von mir bedauert, das meine Grfühle nicht erwidert werden, aber der andere Teil ist glücklich weiter unter ihrem Banner zu dienen. Ich muss diese Gefühle analysieren. Viel Glück Freund.
dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp4:solveig_2conversationcamp5|Ich verstehe. Wir lieben einander, aber wir können nicht zusammen sein. Wenn ich diesen nachgebe, werde ich auf einem Bauerhof enden und auf 10 Kinder aufpassen, und ich könnte das nicht ertragen. Ich wurde geboren, frei zu sein und ein intensives Leben zu leben. Ich möchte die gleichen Freiheiten wie ein Mann genießen. Ich denke, es wäre das Beste, wenn ich gehe.
dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp5:solveig_2conversationcamp6|Verlasst mich nicht Solveig. Wie werden das nie wieder ansprechen, und ich werde mich zurückhalten.
dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp5:solveig_2conversationcamp7|Ja, es ist das Beste, wenn Ihr geht.
dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp6:close_window|Ich will auch, dass Ihr bleibt. Lasst uns nicht darüber reden und Abstand halten. Von nun an werde ich mein Zelt so weit weg von Eurem aufbauen wie möglich. Lebt wohl.
dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp7:close_window|Ja, ich denke, dass ist so das Beste. Viel Glück mein Freund. Möge das Schicksal Euch wohlgesonnen sein
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:asbjorn_conversationcamp1|Es ist interessant, wie christliche Priester über das Ende der Welt sprechen. Es ist sehr ähnlich zu dem, was die Dänen denken. In beiden Fällen wissen wir nicht wann es kommen wird, aber wir sind sich er es wird. In beiden Fällen wir es eine Katastrophe epischen Ausmaßes und von riesigen Armeen die in einer zerstörten Welt kämpfen.
dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp1:asbjorn_conversationcamp2|Aber sie denken anders über andere Dinge. Für die Dänen, hält ein großer Baum die Welt, genannt Yggdrasil. Die Haupt Welt ist Asgard, wo die Götter leben und die von Odin und seiner Frau Frigg regiert wird. Es kann nur über die Rainbow Bridge erreicht werden, genannt Bifrost und bewacht von Heimdal.
dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp2:asbjorn_conversationcamp3|Erzählt mir mehr.
dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp2:close_window|Sehr interessant, aber ich habe keine Zeit mir das anzuhören. Leb wohl.
dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp3:asbjorn_conversationcamp4|Eine andere Welt ist das Eis Land Jotunheim, wo ein Riese lebt, dort hin verbannt durch unsere Götter, die Aesir. Dort gibt es noch Alfheim, die Heimat der Elfen, und Svartalfaheim, bewohnt von dunklen Elfen und Zwergen. Wir sind in Midgard, der mittleren Erde, von den Menschen bewohnt. Unten ist die dunkle Welt der Nifheim, von dem Drachen Nidhogg bewohnt, der an den Wurzeln von Yggdrasil nagt von Anbeginn der Zeit. Eines Tages werden alle Wurzeln gegessen sein und  Yggdrasil wird fallen, beginnt Ragnarok.
dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp4:asbjorn_conversationcamp5|Erzählt mir mehr.

dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp5:asbjorn_conversationcamp6|\nAm Ende der Zeit, Loki, seine Monster und die Toten werden auf den anderen Welten voraus. Heimdall wird sein Horn von der Regenbogen Brücke klingen hören, und Götter und Menschen werden vor Angst zittern, denn sie wissen, dass ihre Zeit gekommen ist. Ein Kampf mit gigantischen Ausmaßen,  der Ragnarok, in denen die Götter und Menschen gegen die Gastgeber des Bösen geraten werden. Die Götter verlieren, weil es gut vorhergesagt wird, und ihre Welt wird von Chaos zerstört werden. Odin wird durch den Wolf Fenrir verschlungen werden.
dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp6:asbjorn_conversationcamp7|Nun, {Playername}, ich denke es ist keine sehr viel versprechendes Schicksal, aber es lehrt uns, dass es, egal ist was wir tun, wir sind zum Scheitern verurteilt. Daher empfiehlt es sich, jeden neuen Tag in vollen Zügen zu genießen.

dlga_conversation_companioncamp:helgi_conversationcamp1|{Playername}, wie Sie wissen, war ich vor langer Zeit im  Land der Rus im Osten. Ich bereiste die fernen Länder der Slawen. Ich hatte schöne Stiefel und wurde reich, bis das Schicksal eine Wendung nahm und mich Westen brachte.
dlga_helgi_conversationcamp1:helgi_conversationcamp2|Was ich Ihnen erzählt habe, ist, dass ich für meine Liebe gelitten habe. Ich verliebte mich in die Frau eines Jarl und sie verliebte sich in mich.

dlga_helgi_conversationcamp2:helgi_conversationcamp4|Ich höre.
dlga_helgi_conversationcamp2:close_window|Kein Gerede mehr. Sie müssen Ihre Hände weg halten von den Ehefrauen anderer Leute.
dlga_helgi_conversationcamp4:helgi_conversationcamp5|Ich habe mein Gesicht schwarz gefärbt und mich in dunklen Sachen gekleidet. In dieser Nacht bin ich in seiner Farm eingebrochen und habe ihn im Schlaf getötet. Dann bin ich in den Westen geflohen, wo mich keiner kannte. Alles was ich dir gesagt habe ist wahr, das ist der wahre Grund warum ich heute bei dir bin. Allerdings habe ich gesehen, dass du ein guter Leiter bist, dem ich mich gerne anschließen würde.
dlga_helgi_conversationcamp5:close_window|Danke für Eure Ehrlichkeit.
dlga_helgi_conversationcamp5:close_window.1|Nette Geschichte, aber Sie müssen Ihre Hände weg halten von den Ehefrauen anderer Leute.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:helgiromance_conversationcamp1|Nach dem Tod von Helge, der Frau in die ich verliebt war, dachte ich, dass es unmöglich sei noch einmal zu lieben, {playername}.
dlga_helgiromance_conversationcamp1:helgiromance_conversationcamp3|Ich denke die alte Wunde ist endlich verheilt, und ich bin bereit für eine neue Beziehung.
dlga_helgiromance_conversationcamp3:helgiromance_conversationcamp4|Es freut mich das zu hören.
dlga_helgiromance_conversationcamp3:close_window|Nun, wir werden sehen ob Ihr besser im Schildwall kämpft.
dlga_helgiromance_conversationcamp4:close_window|Es freut mich zu hören, dass Sie froh darüber sind.
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:helgiromance2_conversationcamp1|Ich muss mit Euch sprechen, {playername}. Es ist mir ernst, aber ich werde es nur ein einziges Mal erwähnen.
dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp1:helgiromance2_conversationcamp3|Ich bin an Euch interessiert, weiß Euch zu schätzen und mag Euch. Ich denke Ihr fühlt genauso, wenn ich sehe, wie Ihr mich immer anseht, aber ich bin mir nicht sicher.
dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp3:helgiromance2_conversationcamp4|Ja, Helgi, ich mag Euch sehr.
dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp3:helgiromance2_conversationcamp4_2|Tut mir leid, aber ich bin nicht an Ihnen interessiert.
dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp4:helgiromance2_conversationcamp5|Ich bin glücklich das zu hören! Nach Helgis Tod dachte ich nicht, dass ich mich nochmal verlieben könnte, aber hier stehen wir. Ich denke wir werden das schon hinbekommen.
dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp4_2:close_window|Es tut mir leid, oh so leid. Ich bin beschämt. Ich dachte...nun, ich lag falsch. Wahrlich, ich werde euch nicht mehr damit belästigen. Ich habe Besseres zu tun.
dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp5:helgiromance2_conversationcamp6|Ja, wir können zusammen sein, aber bitte hör auf damit Helgi zu erwähnen.
dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp5:helgiromance2_conversationcamp7|Nein. Es war nur ein Witz. Ich bin überhaupt nicht an Ihnen interessiert.
dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp6:close_window|Ich bin so glücklich. Ich liebe dich. Lasst mich gehen und meine Sachen in Euer Zelt bringen!
dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp7:close_window|Haltet Eure blöden Sprüche bei Euch, Ihr Miststück! Verzieht Euch!
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:agathinos_conversationcamp1|Hallo {playername}! Mein Freund und ich haben gerade über dich geredet. Wir diskutieren darüber, ob du ein Kriegsherr bist oder eher ambitionen hast ein Brytenwalda zu sein. Oh, tut mir leid, ich wollte nicht unhöflich sein. Hier, bitte treff Heraclio.
dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp1:agathinos_conversationcamp2|--Agathinos ändert seine Stimme, sodass sie elegant klingt--^^Heil {Playername}, ich bin Heraclio von Nicea.
dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp2:agathinos_conversationcamp3|Agathinos, was meint Ihr dazu?
dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp2:agathinos_conversationcamp3.1|Heil Heraclio.
dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp2:close_window|Habt Ihr wieder Pilze zu Euch genommen? Vielleicht solltet Ihr ein wenig schlafen.
dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp3:agathinos_conversationcamp4|Heraclio begleitet uns ein paar Tage, bevor er zurück zu Nicea muss. Ich habe ihn eine lange Zeit nicht gesegen -- nicht seit diesen schmerzhaften, quälenden Tage als Sklave der Norweger. Er wird bald gehen, aber er wollte dich einmal treffen, bevor er geht.
dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp4:agathinos_conversationcamp5|Es wurde auch Zeit, dass ich Euch endlich treffe Heraclio.
dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp4:close_window|Ich habe keine Zeit hierfür. Lebt wohl.
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp5:agathinos_conversationcamp6|--Agathinos changes his voice, making it sharp--^^My brother from another mother, the illustrious engineer Agathinos, has told me a lot about you. He thinks you'll be Brytenwalda, but I think that you're just a warlord.
dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp6:agathinos_conversationcamp7|Agathinos geht es gut. Ich werde bald Brytenwalda sein.
dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp6:agathinos_conversationcamp7.1|Ihr habt recht. Ich bin nur ein einfacher Mann des Krieges.

dlga_conversation_companioncamp:brunhildvsegil_conv1|Ist das dein Ernst Egil? Hast du es mit einen Lagernaachfolger rausgeschafft? Ich dachte, dass du anders wärst und du an uns denkst, aber jetzt sehe ich, dass ich falsch lag. Du bist einfach nur ein Bastard, in jederlei Hinsicht.
dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv1:brunhildvsegil_conv2|Brunhild, Liebling, Du bist nur ein Sklave und ich bin der Sohn des Königs. Unsere Geschichte kann nicht wahr sein. Wir hatten nur etwas Spaß, mehr nicht. Ich dachte du wüsstest das. Du müsstest ein Idiot sein um zu glauben, dass Du den Sohn des Königs so einfach hast. Du wirst immer mein Favorit sein, aber ich habe und werde immer die guten Zeiten mit anderen haben... Wer weiß? Vielleicht werde ich eines Tages eine Frau finden, die ich heiraten werde.
dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv2:brunhildvsegil_conv3|Beruhigen Sie sich!
dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv2:brunhildvsegil_conv3.1|(Sagen Sie nichts)
dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv3:brunhildvsegil_conv4|Glaubst du das wirklich? Du bist mir nicht überlegen. Dein Vater könnte ein König sein, aber deine Mutter war nichts anderes als ein Sklave, wie ich. Du wirst nie jemanden bekommen der besser ist als ich, und du wirst mich verlieren wenn du deine Haltung nicht änderst.
dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv4:brunhildvsegil_conv5|Ich brauche nicht offiziel anerkannt zu sein, für dein Erbe. Jeder weiß, dass ich der Sohn vom König von Dänemark bin. Jede alleinstehende Dame im Königreich, seufzt für mich. Verstehe mich nicht falsch, ich liebe Dich und ich mag wirklich was wir haben, aber ich kann so viel mehr haben.
dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv5:close_window|...^^--Hier gibt es nichts zu tun. Ich rennt solange Ihr könnt.--
dlga_conversation_companioncamp:clovisvshegil_conv1|Ihr denkt wirklich, dass man mit Starken Armen jeden Kampf gewinnen kann, aber das ist nicht immer der Fall. Eine gute Formation oder eine kluge Strategie ist viel wichtiger als kühne Krieger. Auch in einen Duell, ist die Stärke eines Kriegers nicht der Schlüssel zum Sieg.
dlga_clovisvshegil_conv1:clovisvshegil_conv2|Das ist was schwache Leute immer denken, und deswegen plündern wir, die mutigen Soldaten von Svia, oder normale Dänen euer Land. Wenn Ihr mehr Zeit in euer Training steckt und besser werdet, anstatt die ganze Zeit rum zu tanzen, würdet Ihr auch ein richtiges Königreich haben anstatt nur kleines Land wie Ihr es in Frankia habt... wie bis jetzt.
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv2:clovisvshegil_conv3|Try to come openly, without any surprises, and we'll see what happens. I swear that your undisciplined men will fall in a few moments and that none of you would survive, because you don't know when one needs to retreat.
dlga_clovisvshegil_conv3:clovisvshegil_conv4|Ha! Feiglinge! Wie bevorzugen es mutig und tot zu sein, statt ein Verlierer zu sein. Sieg oder Tod!
dlga_clovisvshegil_conv4:clovisvshegil_conv5|Franken geben bessere Krieger ab als die Svia.
dlga_clovisvshegil_conv4:clovisvshegil_conv5_2|Svia geben bessere Krieger ab als die Franken.
dlga_clovisvshegil_conv4:clovisvshegil_conv5_3|Ich denke, dass Ihr beide falsch liegt. Eine gute Armee brauch beides, eiserne Disziplin und starke Krieger.
dlga_clovisvshegil_conv5:clovisvshegil_conv6|Ha! Der Kriegsherr denkt wie ich.
dlga_clovisvshegil_conv6:close_window|Ich werde mir das Gerede sparen.
dlga_clovisvshegil_conv5_2:clovisvshegil_conv6_2|Genau. Ha!

dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv3:bedavsagathinos_conv4|Was lässt Sie dies denken?
; dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv4:bedavsagathinos_conv5|Even your priests live in sin. The Council of Elvira forbade clerics to cohabit with their wives. Otherwise, how can they celebrate the daily Eucharist? If they yield to the temptation of the flesh, what you can expect from their flock?
dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv5:bedavsagathinos_conv6|Versechselt nicht Ehrenlosigkeit mit Enthaltsamkeit. Der Rat von Elvira hat die Heirat nicht den Klerikern verboten, nur das teilen eines Bettes vor eines heiligen Amtes.
dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv6:bedavsagathinos_conv7|Sex ist ein körperlicher Akt. Das versperrt uns dem Wege Christi. Jungfräulichkeit ist eine Bedingung für jedem wahren Mann Gottes. Stimmt ihr mir zu, {playername}?
dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv7:bedavsagathinos_conv8|Ich stimme Ihnen zu, Bede. Diese Menschen müssen pervers sein.
dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv7:bedavsagathinos_conv9|Und was bitte ist falsch mit Sex? Ich weiß, dass Priester mehr Kinder haben als Noah.
dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv7:bedavsagathinos_conv10|Ich will damit nichts zu tun haben. Dies ist ein Streit zwischen Euch und Agathinos.

dlga_start:fighter_talk|Hallo Ihr. Wir verbessern gerade etwas unsere Kampfkünste mit etwas Kampftraining. Ihr seht aus, als könntet Ihr ebenfalls etwas Training benötigen. Warum kommt Ihr nicht herüber und macht mit, wir können Euch einige neue Tricks beibringen. Solltet Ihr Erklärungen oder Kampfkonzepte benötigen, fragt einfach und ich tue mein Bestes um Euch weiter zu helfen.
dlga_start:fighter_talk.1|Was wollt Ihr üben?
dlga_fighter_pretalk:fighter_talk|Sagt mir welche Art der Übung Sie im Sinn haben.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_attack|Ich möchte angreifen üben.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_parry|Ich möchte das Blocken mit meinen Waffen üben.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_combat|Ich möchte einen Übungskampf machen.
dlga_fighter_talk:close_window|[Verlassen]
; dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack:fighter_talk_train_attack_2|All right. There are four principle directions for attacking. These are overhead swing, right swing, left swing and thrust. Now, I will tell you which direction to attack from and you must try to do the correct attack. ^^(Move your mouse while you press the left mouse button to specify attack direction. For example, to execute an overhead attack, move the mouse up at the instant you press the left mouse button. The icons on your screen will help you do the correct action.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:close_window|Dann lassen Sie uns beginnen. Ich bin bereit.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:fighter_pretalk|Eigentlich möchte ich etwas anderes tun.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry:fighter_talk_train_parry_2|Anders als ein Schild, kann das Blocken mit einer Waffe nur Angriffe aus einer direkten Richtung abhalten. Zum Beispiel: Blockst Du Angriffe von oben, wehrst du auch nur Angriffe von oben ab, Angriffe von bspw. aber der Seite, treffen Dich dennoch. ^^(Zum Blocken, rechte Maustaste gedrückt halten und mit der Mausbewegung die gewünschte Block-Richtung bestimmen.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_2:fighter_talk_train_parry_3|Ich werde Euch nun aus verschiedenen Richtungen angreifen und dabei so lange warten, bis Ihr die richtige Blockrichtung ausgewählt habt. Versuche dabei, die richtige Richtung so schnell wie möglich auszuwählen. ^^(Diese Übung geht einfach mit der Funktion 'Automatische Blockrichtung', welche als Standard zu Spielbeginn festgelegt ist. Wenn Du in die Einstellungen gehst, kannst Du diese Funktion umschalten auf 'Mausbewegung' und 'Tastatur'. Dann musst Du deine Blockrichtung selbst bestimmen. Das ist zwar wesentlich herausfordernder, macht das Spiel aber auch wesentlich interessanter. Diese Übung kann sehr nützlich sein, um das manuelle Blocken zu trainieren.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:close_window|Dann lassen Sie uns beginnen. Ich bin bereit.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:fighter_pretalk|Eigentlich möchte ich etwas anderes tun.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat:fighter_talk_train_combat_2a|Kampftraining ist eine sehr gute Möglichkeit sich auf kommende Kämpfe vorzubereiten. Wir werden jetzt gegeneinander kämpfen mit den Übungswaffen, bis einer von uns beiden am Boden liegt. Du könntest ein paar blaue Flecken davon tragen, aber das ist immer noch besser als später tot auf dem Feld zu liegen.

dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:close_window|Dann lassen Sie uns beginnen. Ich bin bereit.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2a:fighter_talk_train_combat_2b|Dann lassen Sie uns beginnen. Ich bin bereit.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2b:close_window|Viel Glück.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:fighter_pretalk|Eigentlich möchte ich etwas anderes tun.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2a:fighter_pretalk|Eigentlich möchte ich etwas anderes tun.
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again|Gut. Das Blocken beherrscht du. Du kannst diese Übung nun wiederholen und dabei versuchen immer schneller zu werden, bis Du der Meinung bist, ausreichend Training gehabt zu haben. Möchtest Du einen weiteren Durchgang?
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again.1|Das war wohl nicht erfolgreich? (Du musst die rechte Maustaste gedrückt halten, um den Block aufrecht zu erhalten) Möchtest du es erneut versuchen?
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_train_parry|Ja. Lassen Sie es uns erneut versuchen.
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_parry|Nein, ich glaube ich bin fertig fürs erste.
dlga_start:fighter_parry_warn|Hey! Wir üben das Blocken, Mann! Sie sollten meine Angriffe blocken und nicht mich angreifen.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_train_parry|Es tut mir leid. Lassen Sie uns das noch einmal versuchen.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_leave_parry|Tut mir Leid. Ich muss diese Übung nun verlassen.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_parry:close_window|Alles klar. Wie Sie es wünschen.
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again|Nun, dies lief ja nicht so gut, oder doch? Fühlen Sie sich nicht schlecht und versuchen Sie nächstes Mal nicht die selben Fehler zu machen. Wollt Ihr das wiederholen?
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_train_combat|Ja. Machen wir eine weitere Runde.
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_combat|Nein. Das war genug für mich.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_combat:close_window|Nun gut. Sprecht wieder mit mir, sobald Ihr Eure Meinung ändert.
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again.1|Hey, das war ein guter Kampf. Ihr habt mich besiegt, aber das nächste Mal werde ich vorsichtiger sein. Wollt Ihr das wiederholen?
dlga_start:fighter_talk.2|Sehr gut. Ihr habt nun gelernt aus jeder Richtung aus anzugreifen. Wenn Ihr wollt können wir das wieder machen, oder wir fahren mit einer anderen Übung fort.
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2|Nicht schlecht. Gar nicht schlecht! Ihr habt, so scheint es, die Grundlagen des Bogenschießens erlernt. Versucht jetzt das Selbe mit der Schleuder. Nehmt die Schleuder und die Steine dort drüben und schießt auf diese drei Ziele. Die Schleuder ist viel einfacher zu bedienen als der Bogen, doch ihr müsst nach jedem Schuss länger nachladen.
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2.1|Guter Gott. Ihr habt wohl keine großen Schwierigkeiten auch die Schleuder zu benutzen. Als nächstes werdet ihr lernen mit Wurfwaffen umzugehen. Nehmt die Wurfspeere, die ihr dort seht und versucht die drei Ziele zu treffen.
dlga_start:ranged_end2|Übt jeden Tag und schon bald werdet Ihr so gut sein wie der Beste.
dlga_ranged_end2:close_window|Ihr könnt noch mit dem Nahkämpfer oder dem Reitlehrer trainieren, wenn ihr das nicht bereits getan habt. Sie können euch ebenfalls wichtige Fähigkeiten vermitteln.
dlga_start:ranged_end|Gut, damit habt ihr die Grundlagen für alle Fernkampfwaffen gelernt. Der Rest kommt mit der Übung. Trainiert fleißig, und mit der Zeit werden ihr besser als der beste Schütze.
dlga_ranged_end:close_window|Ihr könnt noch mit dem Nahkämpfer oder dem Reitlehrer trainieren, wenn ihr das nicht bereits getan habt. Sie können euch ebenfalls wichtige Fähigkeiten vermitteln.
dlga_start:archer_talk2|Seid gegrüßt junger Freund. Ich widme mich täglich mit der Ausbildung der Männer vom Jarl von Kennemer bezüglich Bogenschießen. Solltest Du einen Bogen und Wurfspeere für die Übungen benötigen, sag mir Bescheid und ich leihe dir beides für nur 10 Pfennige.
dlga_archer_talk2:archer_challenge2|Ja ich will Bogenschießen mit Euren Männern üben. (zahlen Sie 10 Pfennige)
dlga_archer_talk2:close_window|Nein, nicht jetzt.
dlga_archer_challenge2:close_window|Schön, mit Ihnen Geschäfte zu machen.
dlga_start:archer_talk|Seid gegrüßt Junger Freund. Ich widme mich täglich der Ausbildung im Fernkampf für jeden, der daran interessiert ist. Falls Du einen Lehrer haben möchtest, sag mir einfach Bescheid und ich trainiere dich im Umgang mit dem Bogen, der Schleuder und dem Wurfspeer. 
dlga_archer_talk:archer_challenge|Ja, zeige mir wie man Distanzwaffen verwendet.
dlga_archer_talk:close_window|Nein, nicht jetzt.
dlga_archer_challenge:archer_challenge_2|Alles klar. Wir trainieren Bogenschießen. Der Bogen ist nicht ganz einfach zu meistern, aber wenn du es geschafft hast, bist du in der Lage schnell und mit großer Kraft zu schießen. Nimm den Bogen und die Pfeile auf und schieße auf die Ziele.
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window|Okay, bin ich bereit.
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window.1|Warten Sie nur einen Moment. Ich möchte zunächst etwas anderes tun.
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2|Ich hoffe du mochtest den Ritt. Jetzt gehen wir über zu etwas schwierigerem. Nimm Dir die Lanze dort drüben und reite den Kurs erneut ab. Dieses mal, musst Du aber zusätzlich die markierten Ziele treffen.
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2.1|Gut! Du hast alle Ziele vom Pferd aus getroffen. Das ist nicht gerade einfach für Anfänger. Deine nächste Aufgabe besteht darin, die markierten Ziele auf dem Kurs mit Pfeil und Bogen zu treffen. Du musst dabei jedes Ziel wenigstens einmal getroffen haben um diese Übung erfolgreich abzuschließen.
dlga_start:horsemanship_end2|Sie waren gut. Üben Sie das Reiten jeden Tag und schon bald werdet Ihr ein Experte als Reiter sein.
dlga_horsemanship_end2:close_window|Jetzt könnt Ihr noch mit dem Nahkampftrainer oder dem Fernkampftrainer sprechen, falls Ihr das noch nicht getan habt. Ihr müsst so viel lernen wie nur möglich, damit Ihr Euch später auf dem Feld erwehren könnt. 
dlga_start:horsemanship_end|Üben Sie das Reiten jeden Tag und schon bald werdet Ihr ein Experte als Reiter sein.
dlga_horsemanship_end:close_window|Jetzt könnt Ihr noch mit dem Nahkampftrainer oder dem Fernkampftrainer sprechen, falls Ihr das noch nicht getan habt. Ihr müsst so viel lernen wie nur möglich, damit Ihr Euch später auf dem Feld erwehren könnt. 
dlga_start:horseman_talk2|Seid gegrüßt! Ich bin für ein wenig Reittraining gekommen, aber meine alten Knochen ächzen bereits so stark, dass ich beschlossen habe, für heute eine Pause einzulegen. Wenn Ihr allerdings die Reitübung machen möchtet, könnt Ihr Euch dafür gerne meine Stute nehmen. Die Übung wird ihr gut tun. 
dlga_horseman_talk2:horseman_challenge2|Ja, danke, dass Sie mir Ihr Pferd leihen.
dlga_horseman_talk2:close_window|Nein, nicht jetzt.

dlga_horseman_talk:horseman_challenge|Ja, ich möchte reiten üben.
dlga_horseman_talk:close_window|Äh, vielleicht später.
dlga_horseman_challenge:horseman_melee_challenge_2|Gut. Jetzt werde ich Euch ein paar Übungen geben, damit Ihr seht, wie man Waffen auf einem Pferd benutzt. Die erste Aufgabe ist einfach. Nehmt das Pferd und reitet damit den Kurs ab. Ob nun schnell oder langsam, bleibt Euch überlassen. Kommt zu mir zurück, wenn Ihr euch mit den Grundlagen vertraut gemacht und eine schwerere Übung haben möchtet. 
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window|Okay, bin ich bereit.
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window.1|Warten Sie nur einen Moment. Ich möchte zunächst etwas anderes tun.
dlga_tutorial_troop_default:close_window|Hey, ich bin hier um zu üben. Geht zum Bogenschieß-Trainer, wenn ihr Hilfe bei Distanzwaffen benötigt.
dlga_start:lord_prison_break_confirm_3|Gibt es eine Änderung der Pläne?
dlga_start:lord_prison_break|Was ist los?
dlga_start:comp_prison_break|Was ist los?
dlga_comp_prison_break:comp_prison_break1|Ich bin gekommen, um Sie hier raus zu holen.
dlga_comp_prison_break:comp_prison_break1a|Es steht Euch frei meiner Truppe wieder beizutreten, mein Freund.
dlga_comp_prison_break1:close_window|Dank dem Himmel, Ihr seid da. Aber wie auch immer, ich gehe nirgendwo hin mit diesen Ketten an den Füßen. Ihr müsst euch irgendwie den Schlüssel von der Wache besorgen.
dlga_comp_prison_break1a:close_window|Gott sei Dank, Ihr seid gekommen! Lasst mich meine Sachen packen und ich werde mich Euch so bald wie möglich wieder anschließen.
dlga_start:drunk_response|Wonach suchen Sie?
dlga_start:drunk_response.1|Starren Sie mich an?
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window|Was für eine Verschwendung...
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window.1|Besser er als ich.
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start|Ich bin mir nicht sicher... Irgendeine Art von Tier, klar
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start.1|Entschuldigung. Bitte nehmen Sie meine Entschuldigung an.
dlga_drunk_fight_start:close_window|Ich werde dir das Grinsen aus dem Gesicht wischen.
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_player_high_renown|Haben Sie eine Ahnung wer ich bin?
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start|Sollte mich das interessieren?
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_player_high_renown|Emmm... Tatsächlich... Ja, ja, ich weiß, wer du bist, mein {reg59? Dame: Herr}. Bitte verzeihen Sie mir, deiner Gnade--das Getränk sein muss. Ich werde jetzt verlassen, werden...
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start.1|Warum? Sie wollen einen Kampf, also bekommen Sie einen!
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:close_window|Ich dachte genauso. Nun entfernen Sie sich von hier.
dlga_start:fistfight_response|Ihr seht aus wie {reg59?lady:fellow} der ziemlich viel einstecken und auch austeilen kann. Ich hätte da ein Geschäftsangebot für Euch. 
dlga_fistfight_response:fistfight_response_2|Wie ist was?
dlga_fistfight_response_2:fistfight_response_2a|Gut -- ich bin froh, dass Sie daran interessiert sind. Hier ist der Plan... es ist ein wenig kompliziert, also hören Sie gut zu. 
dlga_fistfight_response_2a:fistfight_response_3|Ihr und der andere werdet den Kampf hier austragen. Keine Waffen oder Rüstungen - ich werde dort hinten sein, die Wetten annehmen und den Gewinn später an den Sieger austeilen.\nSolltet Ihr verlieren, übernehme ich die Kosten dafür. Ihr habt also nichts zu verlieren - ausser ein wenig Blut natürlich.
; dlga_fistfight_response_3:fistfight_response_4|However, we can't organize this like one of those nice arena bouts, where everyone places their bets beforehand. People will walk in, drawn by the noise, and put a pening or two on whichever one of your two they think is winning. I'll give 'em even odds -- anything else is going to be too tricky for someone who's already on his third flagon of ale.
; dlga_fistfight_response_4:fistfight_response_4a|So, as you can see, the trick is to stretch things out for as long as possible where it looks like you're losing, and people bet against you -- and then come back fast, and win, before the betting can turn. The best way to make money is for you to be battered almost to the floor, and then jump back off your feet and take your opponent down. However, you have to win in the end, in order for me, and you, to make money. 
; dlga_fistfight_response_4a:fistfight_response_5|Moreover, you can't stretch the fight out too long, or people will suspect a fix. So, one of you has to take a punch every so often. I don't care whose blood is spilled, but there has to be some blood.
; dlga_fistfight_response_5:fistfight_response_5a|One more thing. My mate, your opponent, doesn't take to well to complexity, so he's just going to come straight at you. It's up to you to supply the artistry.
dlga_fistfight_response_5a:fistfight_response_confirm|Also, was denkst du?
dlga_fistfight_response_confirm:close_window.1|Ich habe Besseres zu tun
dlga_childsdialog_1:close_window|{s4}
dlga_start:ramun_introduce_1|Guten Tag, {reg59?lassie:young man}.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:ramun_introduce_2|Verzeiht mir. Ihr seht aus wie ein Händler, aber ich sehe keine Waren.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:close_window|Macht nichts.
; dlga_ramun_introduce_2:ramun_introduce_3|A trader? Oh, aye, I certainly am that. My merchandise is a bit different from most, however. It has to be fed and watered twice a day and tries to run away if I turn my back.
dlga_ramun_introduce_3:ramun_introduce_4|Vieh?
; dlga_ramun_introduce_4:ramun_introduce_5|Close enough. I like to call myself the man who keeps every boat on this ocean moving. Boats are driven by oars, you see, and oars need men to pull them or they stop. That's where I come in.
dlga_ramun_introduce_5:ramun_introduce_6|Galeerensklaven.
; dlga_ramun_introduce_6:ramun_introduce_7|Now you're catching on! A trading port like this couldn't survive without them. The ships lose a few hands on every voyage, so there's always a high demand. The captains come to me and they pay well.
dlga_ramun_introduce_7:ramun_introduce_8|Woher kommen die Sklaven?
; dlga_ramun_introduce_8:ramun_introduce_9|Mostly I deal in convicted criminals bought from the authorities. Others are prisoners of war from various nations, or people unable to pay their debts, brought to me because I offer the best prices. However, on occasion I'll buy from privateers and other... 'individuals.' You can't be picky about your suppliers in this line of work. You wouldn't happen to have any prisoners with you, would you?
dlga_ramun_introduce_9:ramun_introduce_10|Ich? 
; dlga_ramun_introduce_10:ramun_introduce_11|Why not? If you intend to set foot outside this town, you're going to cross swords with someone sooner or later. And, God willing, you'll come out on top. Why not make some extra money off the whole thing? Take them alive, bring them back to me, and I'll pay you fifty peningas for each head. Don't much care who they are or where they come from.
dlga_ramun_introduce_11:ramun_introduce_12|Hmm. Ich werde darüber nachdenken.
dlga_ramun_introduce_12:close_window|Denkt darüber nach! Hierbei gibt es viel Silber zu holen, mit Sicherheit. Genug für uns beide.
dlga_start:ramun_talk|Hallo, {Playername}.
dlga_ramun_pre_talk:ramun_talk|Sonst noch was?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners|Ich habe einige Gefangene gebracht. Möchten Ihr sie sehen?
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Ich möchte sehen, was Ihr habt...
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|Es war mir ein Vergnügen Geschäft mit Euch zu machen.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing|Wie nehme ich jemanden als Gefangenen?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing.1|Könnt ihr mir noch einmal über das Festsetzen von Gefangenen erzählen?
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_have_blunt_weapon|You're new to this, aren't you? Let me explain it in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? I'm assuming you have a blunt weapon with you...
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Natürlich.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no|Ehrlich gesagt, ich nicht.
; dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Good. Then all you need to do is beat the bugger down with your weapon, and when the fighting's over you clap him in irons. It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp. I don't have many requirements in my merchandise, but I do insist they be breathing when I buy them.
; dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2|No? Heh, well, this must be your lucky day. I have an old club lying around that I was going to throw away. It's a bit battered, but still good enough to bash someone until he stops moving. Here, have it.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Danke, Mann. Vielleicht werde ich es selbst versuchen.
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Alright, I'll try and explain it again in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_2:ramun_ask_about_capturing_3|Okay, ich glaube, ich verstehe. Irgendetwas anderes?
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_3:ramun_ask_about_capturing_4|Well, it's not as simple as all that. Blunt weapons don't do as much damage as sharp ones, so they won't bring your enemies down as quickly. And trust me, given the chance, most of the scum you run across would just as soon kill you as look at you, so don't expect any courtesy when you pull out a club instead of a sword. Moreover, having to drag prisoners to and fro will slow down your party, which is why some people simply set their prisoners free after the fighting's done. It's madness. How could anyone turn down all that silver, eh?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_4:ramun_ask_about_capturing_5|Sind Sie fertig?
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_5:ramun_ask_about_capturing_7|Just one final thing. Managing prisoners safely is not an easy thing to do, you could call it a skill in itself. If you want to capture a lot of prisoners, you should try and learn the tricks of it yourself, or you won't be able to hang on to a single man you catch.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_7:ramun_pre_talk|Vielen Dank, ich werde es im Hinterkopf behalten.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_prisoners|Gibt es noch anderes das ich mit meinen Gefangenen tun kann?
; dlga_ramun_ask_prisoners:ramun_pre_talk|If you are so inclined, you can interrogate your prisoners while camping, and offer them a chance to join your army. That of course will lower the morale of your army, and some prisoners will agree to join you just to run away back to their families. If you have a figure of authority among your prisoners, such as a Bandit Leader you can ask him to form a band out of your prisoners (you must have more than 50), and send them to raid one of your enemy's villages, or attack them directly in exchange for freedom. But the best way is always for you to sell your prisoners to me.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_leave|Ich sollte besser gehen.
dlga_ramun_leave:close_window|Denkt daran, bringt mir jeden Gefangenen den Ihr habt. Ich werde Euch gutes Geld für jeden einzelnen bezahlen.
dlga_start:nurse_talk|Ich bitte demütig, dass Eure Lordschaft seine Hände dort behält, wo ich sie sehen kann.
dlga_nurse_talk:close_window|Kein Problem.
dlga_nurse_talk:nurse_talk1|Könnt Ihr mir mehr darüber sagen, wie ich Eure Dame dazu überreden kann mich zu heiraten?
; dlga_nurse_talk1:nurse_talk2|I would gladly tell your lordship, if he finds 25 peningas in his pock..., purse.
dlga_nurse_talk2:close_window|Ich glaube nicht, dass ich Sie bezahlen werde.
dlga_nurse_talk2:nurse_talk3|Hier bitte schön. Jetzt sprich!
; dlga_nurse_talk3:close_window|Thank you, your lordship. To be considered as a potential groom, you have to be a person of stature, a pledged vassal or a renowned warrior. At the very least, you should have as much renown as junior lords. Secondly, you must have good relations with the lady, and her father or guardian. Lastly, the most important component is chemistry. The chemistry between you and the lady will largely depend on your charisma, so being ugly, fat, or having a cheap beer or pickle breath would hardly come handy. If you get refused the first time, don't despair, their ladyships are known for playing hard to get, wait a few days and try again. With high persuasion, and charisma, you will eventually prevail, and the lady will agree to get married. Then go and talk to her father or guardian, and get an official blessing from him.

; dlga_start_up_quest_1_next:close_window|Are you all right? Well... I guess you're alive, at any rate. I'm not sure that we can say the same for the other fellow. That's one less thief to trouble our streets at night, although Heaven knows he won't be the last... Anyway, maybe you can help me with something. Let's talk more inside. Out here, we don't know who is listening.
dlga_start:merchant_quest_2a|Hervorragende Arbeit. Ihr habt genügend Männer rekrutiert um gegen die Banditen vorzugehen. Nun, Reisende, welche {s9} betraten, berichteten uns von einer kleinen Gruppe Räuber, welche ausserhalb der Stadt lauern. Ich vermute, dass sie alle von der gleichen Bande sind, der, die meinen Bruder entführten. Jagt sie, besiegt sie und lasst Euch die Position ihres Versteckes verraten. 
; dlga_start:merchant_quest_3a|So, you've found out where they hid my brother? Splendid work. I flatter myself that I'm a fine judge of character, and you look to be a {reg59?woman:man} who can get things done. Now, go out and save his unworthy hide!
; dlga_start:merchant_quest_3b|Well... My brother is home safe. I'm not sure what to do with him -- maybe pack him off to a university outside the Northlands. That way, if he gets knocked on the head in a street brawl, no one can say it's my fault. But that's not your problem. Here's the rest of your reward. It was well earned.
dlga_merchant_quest_3b:merchant_quest_4a|Das Geld ist stets willkommen und ich bin froh nützlich gewesen zu sein. 
dlga_merchant_quest_4a:merchant_quest_4b|Gut! Und jetzt....bist Du daran interessiert etwas mehr zu machen?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b:merchant_quest_4b1|Möglich. Was benötigt Ihr?
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b1:merchant_quest_4b2|Remember how I told you that the bandits had an ally inside the walls? I think I know who it is -- the captain of the watch, no less. Some months ago, this captain, seeing the amount of profit we merchants were making from trade across the frontiers, decided to borrow some money to sponsor a caravan. Unfortunately, like many who are new to commerce, he failed to realize that great profit only comes with great risk. So he sank all his money into the most expensive commodities, and of course, his caravan was captured and looted, and he lost everything.
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b2:merchant_quest_4b3|As a consequence, it seems, our captain turned to villainy to recoup his fortune. I supposed I'd do the same if, the Heavens forbid, I ever faced indebtedness and ruination. Now, any watch captain worth his salary will have a few thieves and robbers on his payroll, to inform on the rest, but our captain decides to employ these bastards wholesale. He brings them into the town, lets them do as they will, and takes a share of their take. You've heard of poachers turning gamekeepers? Well, in the unfortunate land of the Northlands, sometimes gamekeepers will turn poacher. Luckily, there are still a few brave, honest souls in the watch who've told me how he works.
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b3:merchant_quest_4b4|Now -- here's my plan. I could bring this to the attention of {s4}, lord of the city, but that would mean an inquiry, my word against the captain's, and witnesses can be bought and evidence destroyed, or maybe the whole thing will be forgotten if the enemy comes across the border again, and all I'll get for my trouble is a knife in the ribs. In time of war, you see, a king's eye wanders far from his domain, and his subjects suffer. So I've got another idea. I've got a small group of townsfolk together, some men in my employ and some others who've lost relatives to these bandits, and we'll storm the captain's home and bring him in chains before {s4}, hopefully with a few captured bandits to explain how things stack up.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b4:merchant_quest_4b5|Alles was ich brauche, ist jemand, der meine kleine Armee in den Kampf führen kann - und mir fällt niemand besseres als Du ein. Also, was sagst du?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b5:merchant_quest_4b6|Woher weiß ich, dass Du mir die Wahrheit sagst?
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b6:merchant_quest_4b7|Oh, well, I suppose it's possible that I found a dozen bandits who were willing to give their lives to give a passing stranger a false impression of life in old {s4}... Well, I guess you can't really know if my word is good, but I reckon you've learned by now that my money is good, and there's another 100 peningas, or maybe a bit more, that's waiting for you if you'll do me this last little favor. So what do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4b8|Alles klar, ich werde Deine Männer führen.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4_decline|Es tut mir so leid. Das ist zu schnell zu viel. Ich brauche Zeit um darüber nachzudenken.
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b8:merchant_quest_4b9|Splendid. It's been a long time since I staked so much on a single throw of the dice, and frankly I find it exhilarating. My men are ready to move on your word. Are you ready?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_accept|Ja. Gib ihnen das Signal. 
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_decline|Jetzt nicht. Ich brauche zu erst eine Pause bevor ich wieder kämpfen kann.
dlga_merchant_quest_4_accept:close_window|Gut! Und jetzt - schlage hart, schlage schnell und der Kapitän und seine Begleiter werden nicht wissen was sie getroffen hat. Möge der Himmel mit Dir sein. 
; dlga_merchant_quest_4_decline:close_window|Right. I can keep my men standing by. If you let this go too long, then I suppose that I shall have to finish this affair without you, but I would be most pleased if you could be part of it as well. For now, take what time you need.
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window|Sehr gut. Ich werde Banditen jagen.
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome|Warum kommt Ihr nicht mit uns?
; dlga_merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome:merchant_quest_2a|Because I'm paying you to go take care of it. That's the short answer. The long answer is that I've got some leads to follow up here in town, and I have just as much chance of getting knocked on my head as you, if that's what you're asking. But I respect your question. Now, what do you say?
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window.1|Ich kann mich im Moment nicht darum kümmern.
dlga_merchant_quest_3a:close_window|In Ordnung. Ich werde jetzt das Banditenversteck angreifen und deinen Bruder retten.

; dlga_start:merchant_quest_persuasion|You may do as you wish, {reg59?my lady:sir}, but I am disappointed. You would do well to reconsider. I am a rich man, and would show you my gratitude in coin.

dlga_merchant_quest_2:merchant_quest_2a|Nun -- finde und besiege die Banditengruppe.
; dlga_merchant_quest_3:merchant_quest_3a|Now -- go attack that bandit hideout, get my brother back, and show those brigands what happens to those who threaten my household.
dlga_start:close_window.34|Oh -- dem Himmel sei Dank... Bin ich in Sicherheit?
; dlga_start:merchant_closing_statement_2|Ah... {playername}. Things didn't go quite so well as I had hoped. {s5} couldn't quite find it in him to overlook my little breach of the peace. Oh, he's grateful enough that I got rid of his crooked captain -- a guard who'll let in bandits will let in an enemy army, if the price is right -- but he can't exactly have me running around here as a lasting reminder of his failure to take care of things himself.
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_2:merchant_closing_statement_3|Das sieht kaum fair aus...
; dlga_merchant_closing_statement_3:merchant_closing_statement_4|Fair? This is the Northlands, {reg59?my lady:my boy}! Kings do what they will, and the rest of us do as they must. He didn't string me up, and instead gave me time to sell my properties -- even put in a word with the other merchants that they best pay me a fair price, too. That's gracious enough, as kings go -- but he's a weak king, as they all are here, and weak kings must always look to their authority first, and justice second. I suppose I'd do the same, in his shoes.
; dlga_merchant_closing_statement_4:close_window|Anyway, I wouldn't go rubbing your part in this affair in {s5}'s face -- but he's taken note of you, and decided that you're not worth hanging, and that's something to which I'll raise a glass any day of the week. He might even have work for you, further down the road. Or, you can sell your sword to one of his competitors. Anyway, I hope you've learned a bit about what it will take to stay alive in this troubled land, and I suspect that the money you've earned won't go to waste. Good luck.

; dlga_companion_questions_beda1:companion_questions_beda2|{s2}^^Yes, yes! She sent me to talk to you. I was with her... I mean that I was her servant, her slave, when the Danish of Sven Bull Neck took me prisoner. Sven is terrible! I was afraid. I often thought about escaping, but I was so scared that I did not even try.
dlga_companion_questions_beda2:companion_questions_beda3|{s10}
dlga_companion_questions_beda3:companion_questions_beda4|{s4}
; dlga_companion_questions_beda4:companion_questions_beda5|{s2}^^I was the slave of your mother after the Danish captured me in East Engle little more than a month ago. She is not well, but that you already know. She is very ill; is dying. Most of the time, she does not remember who she is and says strange things. The Vikings of Sven Bull Neck think she is a seidr, someone who has spirits, and they consult her about their Fate. Sven has married her because that is believed to improve luck. He says that when he captures you, he will sacrifice you to the gods, because you have the blood of a seidr.
dlga_companion_questions_beda5:companion_questions_beda61|Ich höre.
dlga_companion_questions_beda5:companion_questions_beda62|Sven interessiert mich nicht. Erzähle mir von meiner Mutter.
; dlga_companion_questions_beda61:companion_questions_beda62|Sven Bull Neck is a troubled man, and you have become his obsession for having killed his brother, a man named Olvir. Your mother predicted Olvir's death at your hands, and Sven is angry with his master, Sigurd Ragnarsson, as he was the one who sent Olvir to where you were.^^I've only known Sven a little. I heard the men say he was once a great leader, a shepherd of men. To the contrary, I saw a man who maintains loyalty through fear.
; dlga_companion_questions_beda62:companion_questions_beda63|Sometimes your mother could remember and be herself. Then she would speak about you, her {reg59?daughter:son}. She said that you were destined for greatness, and that your destiny is beyond the control of the Norns that sent Sven. Only she regrets that her end is near and that she will not see you.^^She told me to flee, to find you and remind you that the happiest day of her life was when you came into the world. She also told me that if she never sees you again, she would always be by your side.
dlga_companion_questions_beda63:companion_questions_beda7|Wo ist sie?

; dlga_companion_questions_beda7:companion_questions_beda8|When I escaped, we were close to Grantebrycge, but that was two weeks ago, which is what it took me to find you. The last I heard was that Sven Bull Neck gathered his men and led them to their ships to be at the service of the king.

dlga_companion_questions_beda8:companion_questions_beda92|Ich verstehe. Ich glaube, ich weiß, wohin sie gegangen sind.
dlga_companion_questions_beda9:companion_recruit_backstory_response|Was? Ich habe keinen Schimmer, wer Douar ist. Pass auf, ich kann hier nicht bleiben. Deine Mutter hat mich gebeten, dass ich mich um dich kümmere, also komme ich mit dir mit.
; dlga_companion_questions_beda92:companion_recruit_backstory_response|That is great! Listen. I can't remain here. Your mother asked me to take care of you, so I'm going with you.
; dlga_companion_recruit_backstory_responseasbjorn:companion_questions_asbjorn1|I've had to kill a companion and join a war fleet. Now I must take a judge along?
; dlga_companion_recruit_backstory_responseasbjorn:companion_questions_asbjorn2|I supposed that the Assembly would send someone. I did not think it would be you.
; dlga_companion_recruit_backstory_responseasbjorn:companion_questions_asbjorn6|A doctor, eh? Yes, you are welcome. Let's get on track and join the Viking fleet.
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn2:companion_questions_asbjorn2_1|{s2}^^The Assembly decided I join you, but I am happy to carry it out. It is not my intention to control you, but I must ensure that you join the fleet and come to Englaland. From that moment on, I would like you to see me as a companion, as the doctor your men need.
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn2_1:companion_questions_asbjorn1|I've had to kill a companion and join a war fleet. Now I must take a judge along?
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn2_1:companion_questions_asbjorn6|I guess I have no choice. Let's get on track and join the Viking fleet.
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn1:companion_questions_asbjorn3|{s2}^^I understand that things have not been easy, but the Assembly is the law. It is what keeps the balance in every part of Danmark and even in the whole kingdom. What do you think would have happened without the jurisdiction of the Assembly? Possibly a war between the King Horik and Jarl Sigurd? Who knows, this may still occur despite the Assembly. It would not be the first time. Honor and truth are very important in Danmark, and there are only two ways to satisfy their requirements: with wergild or blood. The line between friendship and hatred between two neighbors sharing the land is very thin. If the Assembly did not exist, hundreds of men would die every day for the slightest of complaints.
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn3:companion_questions_asbjorn4|The Assembly was not fair to me, whatever good there is in avoiding a war.
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn3:companion_questions_asbjorn6|That is fine. Let's get on track and join the Viking fleet.
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn4:companion_questions_asbjorn5|{s2}^^Assembly decisions cannot please everyone. Dare I say, sometimes the judgments of the Assembly are not meant to be fair. Its mission is to maintain order and balance, ensuring that men come to the Assembly to settle disputes instead of killing each other.
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn5:companion_questions_asbjorn6|Let's get on track and join the Viking fleet.
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn6:companion_recruit_signup|I'm sure we will be good friends. We must go to the port of Ribe as soon as you can and ask the port master to join the fleet.

; dlga_bodo_carta1:bodo_carta2|{s2}^^Damn! These Vikings have broken the seal. Fortunately, the letter of King Aldefonso was encrypted. I hope that the Vikings were not able to solve the mystery.
; dlga_bodo_carta1:bodo_carta21|{s2}^^When you gave me to Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye,' I thought it was my end. I would die disgraced for having brought death to the Woden Ric and for not being able to fulfill the mission of my king. Fortunately for me, the letter of King Aldefonso was encrypted, so I'm still alive. The Vikings were not able to solve the mystery and brought me here to torture and tell them the code before the Assembly. The Vikings are not imaginative with torture, but they are brutal. I think if you had not come, I would not have endured much longer alive.
; dlga_bodo_carta21:bodo_carta31|I'm sorry for having given you to Sigurd, my friend. I'm glad to have you back.

; dlga_bodo_carta32:bodo_carta4|Fortunately, they needed me to decrypt the document. If I had given them what they wanted, I would have been dead long ago. Well, I do not want to think about this. Now we're back together and have the letter.
; dlga_bodo_carta4:bodo_carta33|--You open the parchment carefully, avoiding touching Atli's bloodstains with your fingers. You try reading the letter.--
; dlga_bodo_carta4:bodo_carta34|--You don't know how to read, so you cannot understand it. Give the letter to Bodo.--
dlga_bodo_carta4:bodo_carta35|Erzähl mir von diesem Brief, Bodo. Weshalb ist er so wichtig?
; dlga_bodo_carta33:bodo_carta34|--The text is Latin, and it talks about Noah and his ark, with many comments by a monk, but nothing that would appear relevant.--
; dlga_bodo_carta35:bodo_carta34|This letter is important and can change everything, but I need your help to finish my mission. It's time to reveal its secrets...
; dlga_bodo_carta34:bodo_carta5|The trick is to read the first word after each period in the first three lines of each paragraph and read the last words before the period in the following.
; dlga_bodo_carta5:bodo_carta6|{s2}^^Aldefonso became king very recently, after inheriting the throne of his father. He explains at the beginning of this letter that he respects the North and continues the covenants of his father. He sends a messenger to West Seaxe -- me -- and another to Frankia. The North Sea, he says, should be made safe and the Vikings eradicated. West Seaxe is the best place from which to do this, given its proximity to Danmark.
; dlga_bodo_carta6:bodo_carta61|Why would the Kingdom of Asturias be worried about the Vikings?
dlga_bodo_carta6:bodo_carta8|Komm auf den Punkt, Bodo.
; dlga_bodo_carta61:bodo_carta7|{s2}^^My king, Aldefonso, is particularly concerned about the Danish, who are the ones who led the raids on his kingdom in the past. There were two particularly worrying attacks, which King Aldefonso does not want repeated. The first was about twenty-four years ago, during the reign of King Ranimiro, Aldefonso's grandfather, when the Vikings were seen near to Asturias coast with more than 120 ships and 3000 men. Ranimiro quickly gathered his men in Cantabria and Asturias and sent messages to come to Gallaecia, where the Vikings landed to cause damage. Ranimiro was a warrior king. When the Vikings arrived, he was firmly entrenched in a stronghold, so he was able to defeat them in battle and burn 70 ships.
; dlga_bodo_carta7:bodo_carta8|All the same, another big Viking expedition came ten years ago, in the time of King Ordonio, the father of the current king. The fleet of almost 100 ships was led by Bjorn Ironside and Haesten, Ragnar's sons. They disembarked in Gallaecia, near the tomb of Santiago, and caused much damage before they were expelled. After this King Ordonio began contacting other kingdoms in the North that had been attacked by Vikings, too, especially Frankia and West Seaxe. This letter is the finale to years of diplomatic efforts.
; dlga_bodo_carta8:bodo_carta9|The letter says that according to what was promised by his father, Aldefonso agrees to send 20 ships and 600 men to West Seaxe. The men are all veterans of the Muslim wars, fully equipped with chain mail, sword, spear and shield. These men, joining West Seaxe with contributions from Frankia, will cleanse the sea of Vikings. The letter details the route and the ports these men will use on their journey to West Seaxe and asks the very noble king, Aethelred of the Seaxna, to prepare accommodation and food for them. Do you see the importance of this letter, and why Sigurd Ragnarsson, or any Viking leader, for that matter, would want to intercept it?
; dlga_bodo_carta9:bodo_carta91|This alliance may harm the interests of the Danish and their way of life.
; dlga_bodo_carta9:bodo_carta92|Six hundred veteran men would allow West Seaxe to conquer other kingdoms.
; dlga_bodo_carta9:bodo_carta91.1|I'd rather you tell me.
; dlga_bodo_carta9:bodo_carta11|Honestly, I do not care. Now that we have the letter, it's time to go back to King Horik.
; dlga_bodo_carta92:bodo_carta91|No, you are not listening to me. This army is not to be used for conquering. It is an alliance with one objective: cleanse the North Sea of Vikings. Allow me to explain.
; dlga_bodo_carta91:bodo_carta10|Figure that 600 veteran men from each kingdom make 1800 soldiers whose sole purpose is to finish the Vikings. We're not talking about a peasant levy but about professional warriors, well trained and well equipped. This is a huge economic burden for any one kingdom, but if they are well led -- King Aethelred's brother, Aelfred, was chosen for this -- it could free the North Sea of the tempest that now whips it. Therefore, the letter is important to my mission, so Sigurd Ragnarsson made every effort to intercept it. If he can show the letter in the Assembly and so demonstrate the danger that it portends for all of them, the Assembly will make him king with the mission of preventing this alliance.
; dlga_bodo_carta10:bodo_carta11|Then I will give the letter to King Horik, so it will be he who will lead the Danish.
; dlga_bodo_carta10:bodo_carta13|Fine. In that case, I'll give the letter to West Seaxe.
; dlga_bodo_carta10:bodo_carta13.1|I need to see what the Assembly decides. Then I will decide. Save it for now.
; dlga_bodo_carta10:bodo_carta13.2|This letter is a powerful weapon. Keep it safe.
; dlga_bodo_carta11:bodo_carta12|If you give this letter to King Horik or any other Norseman, he will use it to gain power and then destroy all that my kings have fought for over the years. I understand that your concerns now are the Assembly and your mother. I'll help you with that now. Later we will discuss the letter again.
; dlga_bodo_carta12:bodo_carta13|Fine, but don't think I'll change my mind. I will certainly give it to the Vikings.
; dlga_bodo_carta12:bodo_carta13.1|Fine, but don't think I'll change my mind. I will certainly give it to West Seaxe.
dlga_bodo_carta12:bodo_carta13.2|Meinetwegen, reden wir später über den Brief.
; dlga_bodo_carta13:bodo_carta14|Well, we will tell King Horik that the letter was destroyed during the fight with Atli Eiriksson. Then he does not have to worry about Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' using it in the Assembly. This will ensure his support for your cause.
; dlga_bodo_carta14:close_window|Let's not waste any more time but get out of this cave.
; dlga_brunhild_avisa:companion_brunhild_conv|Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' was in the mead hall of the jarl of Kennemer on more than one occasion. He is not just any man, my {reg59?lady:lord}! You know that the jarl of Kennemer is a hard man, but he trembled before Sigurd. Sigurd doesn't say a lot, he never smiles, and his snake eyes burrow into you as if he were trying to read your thoughts. I was but a slave, but I heard things. People say that he is the most dangerous of the sons of Ragnar, a man who would kill you just for coughing nearby or for being in his way on the wrong day.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv:companion_brunhild_conv3|The beautiful Brunhild is right, {playername}. From what I know, Sigurd Ragnarsson is the kind of man that one should avoid. Unfortunately, he blocks our way...
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv3:companion_brunhild_conv4|I don't believe it is so bad. You can't trust the jarl of Kennemer, since he is an accomplished actor who uses every possible tool to try to manipulate others. If he saw an advantage in passing as timid before Sigurd, he would've done that. I would be very careful with him, as he's a man who smiles when you face him, and stabs you with a dagger when you turn. With Sigurd, at least, you always know where he is coming from.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv4:companion_brunhild_conv5|Reginhard is talking without knowing him. I've heard things and seen things. Maybe Reginhard was too busy drinking or betraying someone. Sigurd is spiteful, never forgiving -- and never forgetting...
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv5:companion_brunhild_conv6|You have the gall, woman, to call me a drunk and traitor to my face! You know nothing about me! Watch your words, or you will have to watch your back.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv6:companion_brunhild_conv71|Brunhild! Reginhard has had a hard life. Don't use what happened to Thiaderd against him.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv6:companion_brunhild_conv72|Reginhard! Overcome your regrets and your past and never threaten a member of this party.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv6:companion_brunhild_conv73|Am I with grown people or children? Silence both you, now! Bodo, what do you think?
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv6:companion_brunhild_conv73.1|Bodo, can you give me some advice about Sigurd?
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv71:companion_brunhild_conv73|I'm sorry, my {reg59?lady:lord}. I'm sorry, Reginhard. I let my temper get the best of me.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv72:companion_brunhild_conv73|Yes, I see how things work now. I withdraw my threats, but she should watch her words.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv73:companion_brunhild_conv74|We are at crossroads. Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' has what we need, and your mother's life is in danger. In my opinion, we should go and talk to him, even if it costs us our lives. We have no choice...
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv74:companion_brunhild_conv75|Maybe there is another way. There is a powerful man who hates Sigurd: King Horik Gottfredsson of Danmark, Sigurd's king.
dlga_companion_brunhild_conv75:companion_brunhild_conv76|Warum hasst sein König ihn, Brunhild?
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv75:companion_brunhild_conv8|Imagine what you propose. If you were to speak to King Horik, what would you say?
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv76:companion_brunhild_conv8|Well, I know only what I've heard. They are enemies. Maybe Sigurd wants to be king himself.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv8:companion_brunhild_conv9|Sigurd would be stupid, then. King Horik could banish him, make him an outcast, and strip him of his lands by denouncing him for the slightest infraction at the Thing.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv9:companion_brunhild_conv10|My knowledge is limited, but perhaps Sigurd is as powerful as the king himself. Or maybe King Horik doesn't want more wars in Danmark, after getting his throne after a long war with the other jarls.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv10:companion_brunhild_conv111|Reginhard, what is this 'thing' you speak of?
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv10:companion_brunhild_conv112|Speak with Sigurd or tell King Horik? We have a difficult decision to make.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv111:companion_brunhild_conv112|The Thing or the Assembly is a meeting of free men where disputes are solved and political decisions are made.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv112:companion_brunhild_conv12|I think we should get the protection and support of King Horik. This will give us an advantage when talking to Sigurd and will force him to respect our lives. If King Horik helps us, you can legally claim your mother back.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv12:companion_brunhild_conv13|Do not go straight to Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' now. It may cause the death of your mother, and perhaps you will lose track of Sven Bull Neck forever. Why not see whether King Horik will support us?
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv13:companion_brunhild_conv14|If I had to choose between going straight to Sigurd and getting myself killed or going to Horik and getting your mother killed, I wouldn't know what to say. You got me out of the hole where I was, so I'm fine with your choice whatever it is.

; dlga_companion_questions_bodo1:companion_recruit_backstory_responsebodo|Sven Bull Neck came here after the attack. He left some of his men here with us, the prisoners. I also saw him sending ships on a mission to attack Friese. Then he went north. I think something or someone called him there.

; dlga_companion_responsebodostory41:companion_responsebodostory5|{s2}^^What happened was my fault, {playername}. I was Sven Bull Neck's target, so we were attacked and so on. I commended my soul to Erudino, for I was willing to die, but the Vikings wanted me alive. Therefore, it was I who brought death to my family on the boat. My redemption is that Sven Bull Neck will die at my hands.
dlga_companion_responsebodostory5:companion_responsebodostory61|Also warst DU der Verräter?

; dlga_companion_responsebodostory62:companion_responsebodostory7|{s2}^^I know, and I'm so sorry.
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory63:companion_responsebodostory7|{s2}^^This is not the issue to deal with now... but I promised Erudino.
dlga_companion_responsebodostory64:companion_responsebodostory7|{s4}
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory7:companion_responsebodostory8|I was stupid. I believed that the Woden Ric was safe, but I was wrong. I was betrayed by its captain. The poor man thought that Sven Bull Neck would give him wealth. He was cheated, for, when the Vikings raided the Woden Ric, he was killed. Maybe that is the real reason why we stopped among those shipwrecks...
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory8:companion_responsebodostory9|The Woden Ric captain betrayed me -- indeed, all of us -- but I do not begrudge him that. He was just an idiot, and this cost him his life.
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory9:companion_responsebodostory101|He is lucky to be dead, because I would kill him myself. I hate traitors.
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory9:companion_responsebodostory102|But why was Sven Bull Neck chasing you? Why were YOU his goal?
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory9:companion_responsebodostory103|I'm still waiting to hear about my mother.
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory101:companion_responsebodostory9|{s2}^^Little can be done in this regard.
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory102:companion_responsebodostory11|I was Sven Bull Neck's target, as I had something very important in my hands, something so important that his lord, Sigurd Ragnarson, would kill for it. However, I myself did something terrible before the Viking assault, something I regret.
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory103:companion_responsebodostory102|Your mother is alive. When I awoke, a prisoner on Sven Bull Neck's ship, your mother was next to me. We were the only survivors, or so I thought until you came to my rescue today. Your mother thinks you are dead, my friend.
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory11:companion_responsebodostory13|What did you do?
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory13:companion_responsebodostory14|I gave it to your mother! I thought that it was safer in her hands than in mine... Before you take any fatal action against me in justified anger, you should know that it saved her life, because the Vikings thought she was my master.
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory14:companion_responsebodostory15|Do you understand? If not for that object, she probably would be dead now, like the rest of the people of the Woden Ric. Your mother's disease helped too, because the Vikings think that madness is a touch of the gods. Sven took your mother north with him and left me to my fate here, to be sold as a slave, because he thought she was my master and the object carrier. We must hurry, because when Sven Bull Neck discovers the truth, he will kill her.
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory15:companion_responsebodostory161|Who are you, really, and what is so important to be so wanted by Sven and his lord, Sigurd?
dlga_companion_responsebodostory15:companion_responsebodostory162|Wo hat er meine Mutter hingebracht?
; dlga_companion_responsebodostory161:companion_recruit_signup|That's not important, but I will tell you that I'm not a common traveler. I was sent by the king of Asturias, and what I brought with me is a gift that could change the course of a war! We'll talk about this later. It is urgent now to find your mother. Sven Bull Neck was summoned by his lord, Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' Ragnarsson. Sigurd wants this object badly. He will interrogate your mother about it, because he thinks she has the information he needs. We must find Sigurd soon.

; dlga_companion_reginhard2:companion_reginhard3|Alright, I will stay with you, but tell me why you should not be here.
; dlga_companion_reginhard2:companion_reginhard3.1|Come on, Reginhard, I'm legitimate. Tell me why you should not be here.
; dlga_companion_reginhard2:companion_reginhard3.2|Reginhard, take these 50 peningas. I know that times are bad and friends should help.
; dlga_companion_reginhard2:companion_reginhard3.3|You're such an interesting person. What is your story? (Persuasion)
dlga_companion_reginhard21:companion_reginhard2|{s2}
; dlga_companion_reginhard3:companion_reginhard4|{s2}^^When my family died, I joined the rebels, tough and brave men who struggle to free us from the oppression of the Danish. I fought at their side, and I was happy because being with them, always busy and fearing death, made me forget what happened to my family.
; dlga_companion_reginhard4:companion_reginhard41|Why are you no longer with them?
; dlga_companion_reginhard4:companion_reginhard42|What can you tell me about your leader?
; dlga_companion_reginhard4:companion_reginhard421|How can I find them?
; dlga_companion_reginhard421:companion_reginhard422|You cannot find them. They do not want to be found. These men fear the jarl. Thiaderd only allows people he trusts to join.
; dlga_companion_reginhard422:companion_reginhard423|I am trustworthy. Ask me anything you want.
; dlga_companion_reginhard422:companion_reginhard423.1|I think you're playing with me, and I do not like it. I'm leaving.
; dlga_companion_reginhard423:close_window|{s3}^^Look at me and listen. There are many people having a hard time during this rebellion, particularly the many widows and orphans. There is a woman in Dorestad who collects donations to care for these widows and orphans. Go see her and help. I think you're a good person, but show me. Talk to this woman. Her name is Adda. You can find her in the shop on the wharf. Make a donation in my name. Maybe this will help my people see me with different eyes.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside1:bodo_choiceside21|Bodo, remind me about your mission.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside1:bodo_choiceside22|Yes, I was thinking about the letter, and I've made a decision.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside21:bodo_choiceside22|Your memory is fragile, my friend. When we traveled in the Woden Ric, Sven Bull Neck attacked us to steal a letter that I had. That's where our history began. Sven stole the letter for Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye,' his jarl, but we recovered the letter in Northvegr. We pulled it from the hands of the corpse of Atli, the man whom Sigurd had ordered to protect the letter. Now the letter is in our possession, and we were waiting for the right time to take it to West Seaxe. This time has come.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside22:bodo_choiceside3|I am very happy! Without you, I would not have gotten this far. The letter will coordinate the alliance between West Seaxe, Asturias and the Franks. These three kingdoms will gather together men and ships to cleanse the North Sea of Vikings. In fact, it is possible that the fleet of Asturias is about to be sent, because my mission has been delayed.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside3:bodo_choiceside4_s|I would like to hear the opinions of my other companions before making a decision.
dlga_bodo_choiceside3:bodo_choiceside4_1|Nun, vernehmt meine Entscheidung.
dlga_bodo_choiceside4_1:bodo_choiceside4_2|{playername}, ich schätze ihr solltet euch unseren Rat anhören, bevor ihr entscheidet.
dlga_bodo_choiceside4_2:bodo_choiceside4_s|Natürlich.
dlga_bodo_choiceside4_2:bodo_choiceside9|Nein, der Anführer bin ich, und ich brauche euren Rat nicht.
dlga_bodo_choiceside4_s:bodo_choiceside4|Ich habe nichts weiter zu sagen. Ich werde auch die anderen anhören.
dlga_bodo_choiceside4_s:bodo_choiceside4.1|Ich stimme dem, was {playername} sagt bei, was es auch ist.
dlga_bodo_choiceside4_s:bodo_choiceside4.2|--Er räuspert sich um die allgemeine Aufmerksamkeit zu erringen.--
; dlga_bodo_choiceside4:bodo_choiceside41|Sorry, but I can't be impartial in this matter. My ancestors, my family, are Vikings. The gods have granted us victory upon victory, so that we may acquire fame and wealth. This invasion we have embarked upon is in the footsteps of the sons of Ragnar in Englaland. It is a rich, fertile land worth fighting for. The Danish understand that if you can seize something, it's yours. It is for the inhabitants of the land to defend it and be worthy adversaries.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside41:bodo_choiceside42|The Danish are not beggars, and do not come asking for a piece of land. Danes do not ask for charity from the Saxons. We come with weapons in hand, ready to fight. If the Angles or Saxons defeat us, we will respect their victory, but if we prevail, the gods are with us and the fertile soil belongs to us. That is what I believe. If the Saxons and Franks come northward to fight and defeat the Danish, they are true warriors and the land is theirs.
dlga_bodo_choiceside42:bodo_choiceside43|Euer Rat wird mich bei meiner Entscheidung sicherlich beeinflussen, Asbjorn. Dank sei euch.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside42:bodo_choiceside43.1|This does not clarify anything.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside42:bodo_choiceside43.2|All men have the right to live without having to worry about what the sea may bring.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside43:bodo_choiceside5|I've said all I have to say. You have my support, whatever you decide. It doesn't matter anyway, as fate has already been written.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside43:bodo_choiceside5.1|Whatever you decide, I'm taking my leave and going back to Odinsve. I've made good friends in this party, but I know that now we'll be at odds. Therefore, I leave while we are still all friends.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside5:bodo_choiceside51|I am not as good as Asbjorn at speaking. I'm just a slave who escaped from the hands of a Danish jarl. You know what I think about the Danish, or rather certain Danes who occupy Kennemer. They come, kill and take what they want. If delivering the letter to West Seaxe means a safer North Sea, you have my support. If you deliver the letter to the Danish, on the other hand...
; dlga_bodo_choiceside51:bodo_choiceside6|Your opinion evens my decision, Brunhild.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside51:bodo_choiceside53|What? What would you do if I carry the letter to the Danish?
; dlga_bodo_choiceside53:bodo_choiceside6|I'll stay by your side, even though I do not like your decision. I owe you too much and have spent too much time with you to do otherwise.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside53:bodo_choiceside6.1|I will take another direction. I will not be part of what happens.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside6:bodo_choiceside7|Well... well I do not know what to say. I'm fine here. I think I'll stay with you, choose what you want.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside6:bodo_choiceside61|I'm not happy here. I'm sorry, but I must leave and find another person to follow.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside61:bodo_choiceside62|You are very important to this group, Agathinos. I want you to follow us.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside61:bodo_choiceside7|I see. We'll be better off without you.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside62:bodo_choiceside7|{s2}^^Great! Then I'll stay.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside7:bodo_choiceside71|It is my turn to speak. I have chosen you. I have followed you. I have fought beside you. Therefore, I think I know you better than most, {playername}. I am from Northvegr. We fought against the Danes often, and many other times we drank and laughed with them. They are like us: free men who choose to live out their fate. In Danmark or Northvegr, we have laws, but Englaland does not belong to anyone that matters. They are weak kingdoms with much wealth for the taking. You cannot put a treasure in plain sight of a man, not protect it and simply hope that he does not take it. If you're an idiot, why is it his fault?
; dlga_bodo_choiceside71:bodo_choiceside8|Strength and Chaos? I love your idea, too, Solveig.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside71:bodo_choiceside8.1|Rule by force is not fair and just brings chaos.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside8:bodo_choiceside9|Chaos is good. I'll keep at your side no matter what happens. Too many things unite us.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside8:bodo_choiceside9.1|Chaos is good. Sorry, but I don't fight against free men who have merely chosen to be Vikings.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside9:bodo_choiceside10|{s2}^^I'm worried about all this. I thought you were on my side. We were to go to the king of West Seaxe together, but now I do not know. I sense doubt...
; dlga_bodo_choiceside10:bodo_choiceside111|I have no doubt, Bodo. We will go together to the king of West Seaxe.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside10:bodo_choiceside112|I have decided to give the letter to Rathbarth and the rest of Ragnar's sons.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside111:bodo_choiceside13|{s2}^^I knew you would not fail me. Well, we must go to the king of West Seaxe as soon as possible!
; dlga_bodo_choiceside112:bodo_choiceside14|--His face goes from bewilderment to uncontrolled fury.--^^What? Traitor! I trusted you, I considered you a friend, a brother. Not only have you failed me, but you're encouraging our enemies. After all we've been through, Sigurd and Sven triumph. Well, I will not stay idle. Farewell, {playername}, and hope we do not meet again... for your sake.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside112:bodo_choiceside14.1|{s2}^^What? Traitor! I trusted you. We have our differences and do not always get along, but I thought you'd honor your word. Not only have you failed me, but you're encouraging our enemies. After all we've been through, Sigurd and Sven triumph. Well, I will not stay idle. Farewell, {playername}, and hope we do not meet again... for your sake.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside13:bodo_choiceside131|As I say, the Norns weave the threads at will.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside13:bodo_choiceside131.1|I guess this is farewell. I will be with my family, in Odinsve. Maybe in the future we see each other. I respect your decision, and I leave without rancor.

; dlga_bodo_choiceside131:bodo_choiceside132.1|I'm not happy here, you know. I'm leaving. I think it is time to return to Konstantinoupolis.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside132:bodo_choiceside15|You put me between a rock and a hard place, but I gave my word, and I will keep it. I follow you.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside132:bodo_choiceside15.1|Sorry, but I don't fight against free men who have merely chosen to be Vikings. I said it, and I stand by it. It's time to find a new master. I hope you are treated well in West Seaxe, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside14:bodo_choiceside141|I think you're wrong, but I'm loyal to you and follow you wherever you go.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside14:bodo_choiceside141.1|Our paths diverge, {playername}. Good luck. If you ever go through Friese, you might find me in my father's house... or maybe not.
dlga_bodo_choiceside141:bodo_choiceside15|Nun ... Nun, ich bin bei euch.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside141:bodo_choiceside15.1|I'm not happy here, you know. I'm leaving. I think it is time to return to Konstantinoupolis.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside15:close_window|It's time to get back on track. We have a mission underway.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp1:bodo_danishcamp2|Ragnar's sons are in a difficult situation. Besieged by the Saxons, they can easily be destroyed. We need to talk about this.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp2:bodo_danishcamp3|That would end the Danish invasion. Then the alliance would not be necessary, right?
dlga_bodo_danishcamp2:bodo_danishcamp3_2|Sehr gut. Ich werde euch zuhören.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp3:bodo_danishcamp3_2|Yes, in part, but Danish attacks and Vikings raids have roots deeper than this one siege. Let me explain.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp3_2:bodo_danishcamp4|If you remember, {playername}, my king wants to put a stop to all the Vikings raids and safeguard his kingdom. Even if the Saxons may now force the sons of Ragnar locked in Snotingaham to surrender or kill them, there would still be other sons of Ragnar and other Danish men whose greed knows no limits. Perhaps the Saxons will get a few years of peace, adopt again old enmities with the Mercians, and forget about their alliance with the Franks and Asturians. Even so, the Danish would remain in Northhymbre, and Vikings would still infest the seas. After a few years, another leader would raise an army and would start this raiding and piracy all over again.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp4:bodo_danishcamp5_1|I think what you really fear is that the Saxons can do it without Asturias' help.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp4:bodo_danishcamp6|I think you're exaggerating. Gaed a wyrd swa hio scel!
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp4:bodo_danishcamp5_2|The Saxons could also very well attack Northhymbre and push out the Danish.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp4:bodo_danishcamp5_3|I think the Danish will defeat the Saxons in Snotingaham and then continue south.
dlga_bodo_danishcamp4:bodo_danishcamp6.1|\nWas bekommen Sie, Bodo?
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp5_1:bodo_danishcamp6|You are clever, and you know me better than I thought, {playername}. My mission over the years has been to create and strengthen this alliance. Certainly, it affects me if that breaks. However, I want you to understand the full seriousness of this situation. I do not think I would exaggerate to call this a historical moment.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp5_2:bodo_danishcamp6|You've been in Danmark with me. Do you really believe your words? The Danish will send more men next year, and the year after.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp5_3:bodo_danishcamp6|Yes, this could happen... The Danish are people who stand up to the difficulties they face.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp6:bodo_danishcamp7|I ask you not to give my diplomatic letter to the Saxons just yet. First, we must resolve this siege situation, avoiding a battle if possible, because that would hurt my mission.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp7:bodo_danishcamp8_1|Honestly, without reinforcements, the Danish cannot be interested in fighting right now.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp7:bodo_danishcamp8|I am not sure what to do with the letter. Calm down.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp7:bodo_danishcamp8_2|I'll give it to the Saxons when I see fit.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp7:bodo_danishcamp8_2.1|I'll give it to the Danish when I see fit.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp7:bodo_danishcamp8.1|Do not worry, Bodo. I will follow your advice.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp8_1:bodo_danishcamp8|Yes, I think so, too, but I wanted to talk to you now.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp8_2:bodo_danishcamp8|When the time comes, we'll talk about this issue. Not now.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp8:close_window|Well, I will not keep you any longer. Go see Bjorn Ironside Ragnarsson.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo1:companions_despuesduelo2|What happened was inevitable, my friend. It was him or you.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo2:companions_despuesduelo3|I understand the weight you carry on your shoulders, because I just experienced the same, after the massacre on the Woden Ric. I know no words can soothe you, but nobody expected Reginhard's betrayal. None of this is your fault.

; dlga_companions_despuesduelo3_1:companions_despuesduelo4|{s2}^^My God, my God, I... I'm guilty, and I don't understand why you've forgiven me. I let Sigurd lie to me. I thought it was an opportunity to be happy with a house and a wife. So I blamed you for the death of Thiaderd, but the fault is really mine. I started it all when I betrayed him to the jarl of Kennemer. Everything I do, I do wrong, and now Egil is dead because of me. I deserve to die. Please kill me.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo3_1:companions_despuesduelo5|{s2}^^I do not understand all the tears. Reginhard betrayed us. I trusted him. Everybody trusted him. I thought he was a good guy, and what he did was spy for Sigurd. He sold us out for a house and a woman. Reginhard was a piece of shit and deserved his death.

; dlga_start:lord_pretalk|Good job, {playername}! Looks like you were able to track down the bandits and show them what happens to those who would destroy someone else's property. Here is your reward: {reg5} peningas. It is well earned, and I am very grateful.
; dlga_start:lord_pretalk.1|Well, {playername}, I guess that at least some of those brigands eluded you, and of course it will be the peaceable citizens of this land who will pay the price. Still, it was good of you to try.

; dlga_lord_wedding_reschedule:lord_return_dower|I have no faith that this wedding will be concluded. Please return my dower.
; dlga_lord_return_dower:close_window|Well, that is your right, if you indeed have no confidence in our family's commitments. Take your money.
; dlga_lord_talk:gartnait_historia|I noticed that some of your warriors painted their bodies.
; dlga_gartnait_historia:lord_pretalk|How? That's not important.
; dlga_gartnait_historia:gartnait_talk1|What? -- His eyes widen. -- As you know, they are ritual paintings, {playername}.
; dlga_gartnait_talk1:gartnait_historia1|I'd like to know why they painted their bodies and how I can get the same.
dlga_gartnait_talk1:lord_pretalk|Danke.
; dlga_gartnait_historia1:gartnait_historia2|Among my people there are Goidels and Picts. They retain very few of their ancient traditions. We are Christians, but -- he whispers -- many customs of our ancestors still exist among our people. Young warriors are expected to paint their bodies and join the fray of battle and war before they are accepted in their homes as full-grown men. Women have the right to choose wives for their brothers, and children inherit through their mothers' lineage.^^Painting our bodies and joining warrior brotherhoods is part of a tradition in which young people must pass some tests in order to reach maturity. Some tests still involve venturing into distant lands in search of cattle and treasures, then to come home with enough wealth to start a family.
; dlga_gartnait_historia2:gartnait_historia3|When the young people return, the war paint is removed from their bodies, and they marry and integrate into regular society. There are not a few Pictish women who decide to paint their bodies to participate in this test of initiation.^^-- He smiles. -- It's up to you whether to paint your body or not. If you do, you devote yourself to a very old tradition and to powers that are beyond our understanding. Form or join a group of young people. Make a name for yourselves. Learn the camaraderie, friendship, and pride of being a Pict. Learn to command and obey. Gain the respect of your peers. Meet several {reg59?men:women}... When you've proven your worth, remove the war paint and return to society.
; dlga_gartnait_historia3:gartnait_historia4|I want to paint my body.
; dlga_gartnait_historia3:lord_pretalk|Stop. Your story is prattle. You are a bunch of idiots.
; dlga_gartnait_historia3:lord_pretalk.1|Thanks for the information.
; dlga_gartnait_historia4:gartnait_historia5|Well, it's not ancient times any more. There are no longer strict rules or rituals. To tell you the truth, I actually feel that I am more Gael than Pict. Remove your garments and let my servant trace the lines on your body. Good luck, young {reg59?lady:man}, with your rite of passage!
; dlga_gartnait_historia5:lord_pretalk|Thank you, Toiseach.
; dlga_lord_talk:eormenred_historia|I heard that you know Pictland.
; dlga_eormenred_historia:lord_pretalk|I am sorry, but I hardly know you. I do not feel comfortable sharing my knowledge right now. God the mid sie.
; dlga_eormenred_historia:eormenred_talk1|What? --His eyes widen.-- Yes, but... do you plan to travel north into Alban? You should not go, {playername}. I was there when I was young and had a fine band of warriors by my side, my beadupreat. Would you care to hear my story?
; dlga_eormenred_talk1:eormenred_historia1|Sure. I am interested.
dlga_eormenred_talk1:lord_pretalk|Nein, habt Dank. Ich habe andere Dinge, die meine Aufmerksamkeit erfordern.
; dlga_eormenred_historia1:eormenred_historia2|Picts are strange, weird people. --He whispers.-- Some young warriors paint their bodies and become dangerous bandits. Pictish villages are dirty and hidden between the high peaks and dense forests that cover their land. I remember that from several years ago, when I took a war band of young warriors there to plunder and pillage.
; dlga_eormenred_historia2:eormenred_historia3|After days of travel, we spotted a village spread about a strange construction. Today, I know it was a Broch, a fortress erected by the ancients. The Picts found the ruins, repaired them, and built their homes under its protection. We felt a sudden surge of happiness. There was booty, cattle and women. -- He smiles. -- The doors and gates were wide open. They were not expecting us, we all thought. We started howling like wolves, excited by the prospect of battle. We prepared our spears and swords, gathered our shields and ran, certain that our victory was going to be as easy as it would be profitable. We were young, passionate, and anxious to show our worth. What would you have done?
; dlga_eormenred_historia3:eormenred_historia4|Mm... Too easy. You should have suspected a trap, but please continue,
; dlga_eormenred_historia3:lord_pretalk|What a sorry tale! You behaved like a bunch of untrained recruits.
; dlga_eormenred_historia4:eormenred_historia5|Yes, I know you are right, but back then we all were exceedingly impetuous. --He beats his chest.-- As for them, well, they were expecting us long before we even knew their village existed. They had archers, by Woden! ...beg pardon, by God! and an awful lot of arrows. Their Isenscur, or rain of arrows, was death to my men. One for one, arrow by arrow. Only I survived, for in fact they knew who I was... I was captured and forced to do their queen's bidding. When she tired of me, they ransomed me for a treasure worth many gold coins. My father gladly paid it when they sent him my left ear inside a finely wrought leather pouch. Hear me! Forget Pictland!
; dlga_eormenred_historia5:lord_pretalk|Thank you, my lord. I have learnt much from your story, and I will not meddle in Pictish affairs.
; dlga_eormenred_historia5:lord_pretalk.1|What a sorry tale! Your men behaved like untrained recruits -- with you as an idiot-in-chief.
; dlga_start:close_window.52|Now you die!

; dlga_seneschal_quest_irish:seneschal_quest_2f|You have done it, my {reg59?lady:lord}!

; dlga_seneschal_quest_5:close_window|No. Farewell.

; dlga_start:maelbresail_pactofinal|{playername}, when you escaped my trap, I came to hide here. From the fact that you have managed to find me, I perceive that, contrary to appearances, you are someone with resources.
; dlga_start:maelbresail_aftermorrigan1|Welcome, {playername}. The abbot of Finian informed me that you eliminated the main enemies of my lord and mine. I expect that you've found our rewards a more than acceptable way to get rich.

; dlga_maelbresail_dialog1:close_window|[Say nothing]
; dlga_maelbresail_dialog2:maelbresail_dialog3|Ah, {playername}! The abbot spoke wonders about you and your diligence in solving my problems.

; dlga_maelbresail_dialog3:maelbresail_dialog4_1|It is likewise a pleasure to meet you, my lord. Your enemies are at a farm near Dinas Bran.
; dlga_maelbresail_dialog3:maelbresail_dialog4|Flaithbertach's grandchildren are at a farm near Dinas Bran, my lord.
; dlga_maelbresail_dialog3:maelbresail_dialog4.1|Flaithbertach's grandchildren are at a farm near Dinas Bran.
; dlga_maelbresail_dialog4_1:maelbresail_dialog4|I guess you still do not know me and the abbot gave no warning, but I prefer short and direct answers. My occupations are numerous and my time very limited.
; dlga_maelbresail_dialog4:maelbresail_dialog5|Your news is excellent. In fact, I want to reward you personally, in addition to what the abbot promised you, with 8,000 peningas. The people who work for me do not have to worry about money or wealth. All that I ask of them is to be faithful and execute my orders promptly.
; dlga_maelbresail_dialog5:maelbresail_dialog6|Thank you so much, my lord.
dlga_maelbresail_dialog5:maelbresail_dialog6.1|Habt Dank.
; dlga_maelbresail_dialog6:close_window|Well, I'm sorry I don't have more time. Ask the abbot to give you your reward and your next assignment. Your next task is particularly important, so put all effort into it. Now I have to go. I wish you all well.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan2|Honestly? I expected more.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_1|I do what I have to do.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_2|It has been a pleasure to serve you and kill your enemies.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_3|You lied to make me a murderer of your enemies.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan2:maelbresail_aftermorrigan3|You are ambitious, but I think you've been well paid. I will not give you a pening more until you deserve one.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan3|That's important to me. In this world, it is not easy to find effective people.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_2:maelbresail_aftermorrigan3|I know. Not all patrons reward their servants as well. Although it is sometimes difficult to know if your loyalty is to me or my money.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_3:maelbresail_aftermorrigan3|You were commissioned to do something, and you agreed to do it. Nobody forced you to accept. Why now come, whining? I cannot stand the capricious nor the faint-hearted.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan3:maelbresail_aftermorrigan4|--He chuckles.--^^I hear Morrigan tried to save her life with lies. What were her last words?
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan4:maelbresail_aftermorrigan5|She told me she was the last of the line of Flaithbertach.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan4:maelbresail_aftermorrigan5_2|She died before I could talk to her.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan5:maelbresail_aftermorrigan6|Working for Aed mac Niall, Ard Ruire of Eriu, you sent me to kill the remnants of the family Flaithbertach in order to remove potential rivals for the throne.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan5_2:maelbresail_aftermorrigan6|Do not lie! I know when you're lying. Liars have a place not at my side but on the gallows!
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan6:maelbresail_aftermorrigan7|You've done a huge favor to Eriu, if you're not aware of it. This island is populated by numerous clans, but each feels entitled to rule over others. The social system is a pyramid -- the weaker subject to the stronger, but all led by the high king, the Ard Ruire. However, the elements of this system constantly mutate, and clan alliances break according to changing interests. In sum, it is very difficult to rule this land.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan7:maelbresail_aftermorrigan8|I believe Aed mac Niall is a good leader, as he favors my interests, and therefore yours. However, Flaithbertach was a man beloved by the Ui-Neill, and his death caused much discomfort. His children could easily have taken up arms with many northern clans. As an internal war within the Kingdom of Aileach would only favor our rivals, the Southern Ui Neill, in their desire to secure once again the throne at Tara. Ard Ruire Aed is strong leader, uniquely able to keep the Vikings at bay. Do you understand?
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan8:maelbresail_aftermorrigan9_1|There is no need to justify our actions to me.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan8:maelbresail_aftermorrigan9_2|I hate politics.
dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan8:maelbresail_aftermorrigan10|Natürlich.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan9_1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan10|Justify? No, I am happy to do so.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan9_2:maelbresail_aftermorrigan10|Politics is what moves the world, but it's a game that you win or die.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan10:maelbresail_aftermorrigan11|Everything I've done has been for the benefit of Eriu. If I had directly attacked Flaithbertach's children, they would have become martyrs, and certain northern clans could have taken up arms under that pretext. You, however, were not among my people, so nobody can associate me. You and the abbot of Finian just killing with some other malefactors. We have not seen one another many times. Now it is your name that is famous for killing the children of Flaithbertach.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan11:maelbresail_aftermorrigan12|So you refuse me? After all I've done?
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan11:maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_2|I want more money, or I will talk to others about your involvement.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan11:maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_3|Traitor! Your hands remain clean while I will be hated by all the lords! (Intelligence)
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan11:maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_4|Well, Morrigan is still alive.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan12:maelbresail_aftermorrigan13|I never promised you anything I haven't paid. This arrangement was important to Eriu. Now, at least, I help you leave this island. Here many will hate you for killing Flaithbertach's children. I don't abandon any who has served me well, no matter how mercenary. I could reward you with 50,000 peningas. This should help you in your new life far from here.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_2:maelbresail_aftermorrigan13|Well, I understand. I guess I can pay you for your silence. How about 100,000 peningas? This should help you in your new life far from here
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_3:maelbresail_aftermorrigan13|You're smarter than you act. I cannot lie. This much is true: many a lord has put you on his list of enemies, but it was for the good of Eriu. However, I desire to give you enough gold for your exile from Eriu. Seventy thousand peningas should be sufficient to start a new life far from here.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_4:maelbresail_aftermorrigan13|Aah... I understand you're worried and will try to use anything to scare me. I know Morrigan is no longer a threat. You must leave Eriu as soon as possible, but this does not mean I not care about your welfare. I'll give you 30.000 peningas. This should be sufficient to start a new life far from here.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan13:maelbresail_aftermorrigan14|I guess I have no choice. I take your money and leave this island.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan13:maelbresail_aftermorrigan14.1|Give me the money; then see what I'll do.

In fact, I will give a banquet in your honor while we talk about the way to clear your name. Farewell, {playername}.
; dlga_maelbresail_pactofinal:maelbresail_pactofina2|I guess it is fair to recognize that you've exceeded all my expectations. You're much too dangerous to have as an enemy. I offer here and now peace between us. I'll pay you 50,000 peningas for all the harm I've caused you, and from this moment, our paths never cross again. You will not pursue me, and I won't send men to kill you. It will simply be as if we had never known one another. I promise before my mother, present here. Do you agree?
; dlga_maelbresail_pactofina2:maelbresail_pactofina3_1|Well, we both are but businessmen. I accept your money. You will never again hear from me.

; dlga_start:morrigan1_dialog|Do you come to kill me, murderer? Your lord, Mael Bresail, would be happy to end my lineage.
; dlga_start:morriganleave_final1|{playername}, I want to thank you for all your help. Without you, I would never have avenged my family. Although the death of Mael Bresail has not given me any joy, I feel I've done the right thing. My family can now rest in peace. My travels with you are over. I leave you because I need to remove myself from the world I have known and find a place to live in peace, far away from Eriu. I need to leave behind my past to build a future, and that means leaving you.

; dlga_morrigan1_dialog1:close_window|My father, Flaithbertach, could have been king, but he was killed by his own brother, Aed of Aileach, and your master, Mael Bresail. You plan to kill the last member from Flaithbertach's lineage. The gods and men curse your name.^^For some time now, I have owned nothing more than my life. Yet I do not fear death and think maybe it may remedy my torment.^^(Before you can do anything, Morrigan casts herself on your weapon, inviting death. She utters no sound. You watch her eyes close and peace spread across her face.)
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog2:morrigan1_dialog4|Then you kill without knowing your victim or why she should be killed, murderer?
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog3:morrigan1_dialog4|Then why do you work for him and his damned lord, Aed of Aileach, and kill their enemies for them, murderer?
dlga_morrigan1_dialog4:morrigan1_dialog5|{s10}
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog5:morrigan1_dialog6|Bal Luighne? I could have destroyed that village long ago, but never attacked. I just terrorized the locals so that they would leave the place and leave this land to me. I only seek a place to live and feel protected, but the peasants are stubborn and Mael Bresail found out where I am. Then he sent you to kill me and finish off my lineage. You may have no idea, but your patron is implacable. Recently, he sent men to kill to my brother in Pictland and his sons -- just children -- near Caer Meguaidd. Now, I am last of my family. I see it was impossible to hide from Mael Bresail. I found this remote part of the world and forgot my name by taking that of the goddess, Morrigan. Yet here you are to kill me.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog6:morrigan1_dialog1|Liar! You are trying to confuse me. It's time to die.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog6:morrigan1_dialog7|Then that would make you... Flaithbertach's daughter? No wonder you are a menace!
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog7:morrigan1_dialog8|My father, Flaithbertach, could have been king, but he was killed by his own brother, your master. This is Eriu. If you want the throne, you have to catch and eliminate all potential competitors. Fratricide is practically a way of life. Aed was faster to the deed than my father. Then, with the help of Mael Bresail, he killed my mother and the rest of my family. Just my brother, his sons, and I escaped, but Mael eventually found us. Now only I am alive, but even so, now at the tip of your sword.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog8:morrigan1_dialog1|Even so, you did too much damage to the people of Bal Luighne. You pay now with your life.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog8:morrigan1_dialog9|Mael Bresail used me? I am NOT his hired murderer!
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog9:morrigan1_dialog1|Well, that's hardly my problem. I'm tired of fleeing. Everyone I cared for is dead. I just want to see them again and be at peace. Go back to your master and collect your reward, murderer. I do not begrudge you that.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog9:morrigan1_dialog10|Mael Bresail uses everybody. What do you want to do now?
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog10:morrigan1_dialog1|You did too much damage to the people of Bal Luighne. You pay now with your life.

; dlga_ulf_testigo10:ulf_testigo11|He is Orm the Black, guest of Ulf Thorinsson and future owner of his farm and daughter. I am not in the habit of eavesdropping, but since everything related to this farmstead is now my business, I've decided to introduce myself and act.
; dlga_ulf_testigo11:ulf_testigo12|So... Orm. How is it that you are the future owner of this farm?
; dlga_ulf_testigo11:ulf_testigo13|I do not care who you are. This is a private matter. Go away.
; dlga_ulf_testigo13:ulf_testigo12|Oh, I don't think so. This farm and the girl pregnant because of you will be my property tomorrow, so you will negotiate with me and not with this old fool.
; dlga_ulf_testigo12:ulf_testigo14_1|{playername}, my father has his pride, but we need your support. Orm Svarti is a berserk and a duelist. He is an evil person, but no one can stand up to him. He arrived shortly after you left us and asked for my hand, which my father withheld. Then he challenged my father to a duel to the death. Orm will kill my father and then stay with me on the farm. My father is old and cannot deal with this man. Please be our second.
; dlga_ulf_testigo14_1:ulf_testigo14|{s2}^^This man is scum, {reg59?my lady:my lord}. He challenges old defenseless peasants in order to steal everything they have. Worst of all, he wants to make Ulf's daughter a slave... and who knows what will happen to the child in Thora's belly.
; dlga_ulf_testigo14:ulf_testigo15|Ignore them. You're lucky I'm here. Ulf will not testify against you in the Assembly on account of his death, and the girl will not be your problem because I will take care of her and the rat within. And since I like you, I'll give you half price. All you have to do is give me 2000 peningas. What do you say?
; dlga_ulf_testigo15:ulf_testigo16_1|It's a deal, Orm. Take this money, and thanks for taking care of this matter.
; dlga_ulf_testigo15:ulf_testigo16_2|Ulf will be dead tomorrow, so my problem is solved. Why pay you a single pening?
; dlga_ulf_testigo15:ulf_testigo16_3|I will pay wergild of 4000 peningas to Ulf now, and the case is closed.
; dlga_ulf_testigo15:ulf_testigo16_4|No, I'm afraid not. I hate injustice and must settle my debt. I will fight on Ulf's behalf.
; dlga_ulf_testigo15:ulf_testigo16_4.1|No. The two matters are separate. I will both pay my wergild of 4000 peningas and fight.
; dlga_ulf_testigo16_1:ulf_testigo16|Well, well. A farm, a pretty girl and 2000 peningas to boot. The gods have always loved me. Good travels and good luck so that, someday, in the unlikely event that you ever make anything of yourself, we may meet again.
; dlga_ulf_testigo16_2:ulf_testigo16|Oh, well, right you are. Then get off my farm. Good travels and good luck so that, someday, in the unlikely event that you ever make anything of yourself, we may meet again.
; dlga_ulf_testigo16_3:ulf_testigo16|Well, his money is my money. If you are such an idiot, the better for me. A farm, a pretty girl and 4000 peningas to boot. The gods have always loved me.

; dlga_ulf_testigo22:ulf_testigo23|The gods bless you, {playername}. We will always be indebted to you.
; dlga_ulf_testigo23:ulf_testigo24|I did not expect this selfless reaction. I know that I do not stand a chance against Orm Svarti, so I'm very grateful. Whatever happens, know that I will not testify against you at the Assembly. Ragnarsson will not like that much, but it's you that are here for me. What's more, I won't ask wergild for my daughter. What you do makes up for any debt between us. Thank you. We are now at peace.

; dlga_prisionero_interrogation44:prisionero_interrogation43|Well, we spared some men, even a madwoman who talked nonsense. Maybe your mother is among them.
; dlga_prisionero_interrogation45:prisionero_interrogation22th|Sven Bull Neck took them with him. He was going to leave them in his hideout before continuing his journey north. The hideout is in Danmark. It is a good place and well defended, but I will not tell you where it is. I will not betray my masters just so you can kill me.
; dlga_prisionero_interrogation22th:prisionero_interrogation22th2|{s3}^^There is no need to torture him for that information. There is a man in the port of Ribe who deals with the Vikings for their slaves. He is a Frisian from Doccinga who has thrived in Ribe as port master. One often finds him outside, by the docks. He is not a good person, but he will sell whatever information you may require. When you talk to him, please do not mention my name, because it was I who forced him to leave Doccinga some years ago.
; dlga_prisionero_interrogation22th2:prisionero_interrogation22|I have nothing to add.
; dlga_start:close_window.61|Awaiting orders.
dlga_start:close_window.62|Ich habe keine Zeit für euch. Lebt wohl.
; dlga_start:harald_meeting1|Heill, captains! I have sent for you because tomorrow at noon we will reach the coasts of Northhymbre. It is time to release the details of the mission and talk about the problems that plague this fleet.
; dlga_start:sven_comprapr|The men are strong, with healthy teeth and hard muscles. The women are healthy, but they are sisters. They are the last slaves I have, so they go together in the package, or nothing. However, I'll give you a discount, and they will cost you only 900 peningas.
; dlga_start:svenlair_1|Who are you, and what do you want?
; dlga_start:revenge_kingmen|Heill, {playername}! Heill, Egil, vinr! We received your message and we are here. We hope we are in time to come to the party.
dlga_start:close_window.63|Mögen die Götter uns schützen!
; dlga_revenge_kingmen:revenge_kingmen2|Sure, Harald! We're still waiting for the men of Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye.' My friend, here, is eager to meet Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_revenge_kingmen2:revenge_kingmen3|Welcome, Harald. We appreciate the help of King Horik.
; dlga_revenge_kingmen3:revenge_kingmen4|I'm sure of it. Until the time comes, I will keep my men hidden, ready to intervene if things get ugly. The king was very clear, {playername}. You must not begin hostilities. In fact, he wants you to avoid confrontation if at all possible.
; dlga_revenge_kingmen4:revenge_kingmen5|It will not be me who starts this battle. I promise.
; dlga_revenge_kingmen4:revenge_kingmen5.1|Sven Bull Neck did me much evil. I promise nothing.
; dlga_revenge_kingmen5:close_window|The king is a man who likes his wishes to be executed. Now we enter the farm. My men are hungry and thirsty.
; dlga_harald_meeting1:harald_meeting21|I am especially interested in this meeting. I have long been waiting to hear from my mother.
dlga_harald_meeting1:harald_meeting3|(nichts sagen)
; dlga_harald_meeting21:harald_meeting3|I think you may be wondering what our guest may have to say about this, but first we go to the most urgent matter.
; dlga_harald_meeting3:harald_meeting4|In Northhymbre, our Danish brothers have become strong. They control the kingdom through a puppet king. There are small uprisings of Angles, but these are localized and severely repressed. Nothing serious. The latest news we have is that the sons of Ragnar have moved south and taken a place, known as Snotingaham, in Mierce. The king of Mierce has not taken this well. He has besieged them there with his army, supported by the king of West Seaxe. We fear that the Ragnarssons may be in a hard place, so our mission is to go to Jorvik and join the forces that are gathering under Rathbarth, another of the sons of Ragnar, in support of his brothers. From there we will move south to meet the Angles and Saxons. With a little luck, we will kill their kings and the road south will be opened for plunder. You will come back rich to your wife and kids this year.
dlga_harald_meeting4:harald_meeting4_1|Ich hoffe doch. Ich möchte nicht noch mehr Mäuler füttern müssen.
; dlga_harald_meeting4_1:harald_meeting4_2|{s2}^^You should have thought of that before having three wives and twenty children!
; dlga_harald_meeting4_2:harald_meeting5_1|I'm sure that he has as many bastards among his servants!
; dlga_harald_meeting4_2:harald_meeting5_2|The issue is serious. How many men do Mierce and West Seaxe have?
; dlga_harald_meeting4_2:harald_meeting5_3|Sounds like a good plan, Harald. My men will go in the front!
; dlga_harald_meeting4_2:harald_meeting5|I agree.
dlga_harald_meeting5_1:harald_meeting5|{s2}.
; dlga_harald_meeting5_2:harald_meeting5|That is hard to say. The information we have comes from merchants and travelers. They speak of thousands of men. It hardly matters, though. The Angles and the Saxons are weak people, fully domesticated by their kings. It will be like attacking housewives.
; dlga_harald_meeting5_3:harald_meeting5_4|{s2}^^Well, well. We have here an authentic toady. It seems there is always someone who is willing to stoop to any depth to gain favor with the boss.
; dlga_harald_meeting5_4:harald_meeting5|I cannot stand sycophants, {playername}. Now let's move on to the serious stuff.
; dlga_harald_meeting5:harald_meeting6|{s2}^^Although everything is clear and our goal is near, it seems that problems with Sven Bull Neck don't stop cropping up. This captain, Oleif, is now with us, and he has very serious news. Go ahead, Oleif.
; dlga_harald_meeting6:harald_meeting7|{s2}^^I will not beat around the bush. Sven Bull Neck is unwilling to share command with Harald Haraldsson. At first opportunity, he will kill Harald and take the command. It may occur as we land, though I cannot be sure. Maybe my desertion of his party will change his mind.
; dlga_harald_meeting7:harald_meeting8|I am making a guard rotation during the trip. When we land, I will challenge Sven to a duel to the death. Sven Bull Neck is a lunatic, but he's a dangerous lunatic.
; dlga_harald_meeting8:harald_meeting8_1|Sounds good. You have my full support, even if you decide to attack his boat while he is still unprepared.
dlga_harald_meeting8_1:harald_meeting9|Ihr habt auch meine Unterstützung, Harald. Dieser Mann, Sven, ist äußerst gefährlich.
dlga_harald_meeting9:harald_meeting11|Ich habe lange genug gewartet! Was ist mit meiner Mutter?
; dlga_harald_meeting9:harald_meeting11.1|You have my support, but I'd like to ask about my mother.
; dlga_harald_meeting9:harald_meeting10_3|I think Sven Bull Neck would make a better commander of this fleet than you.
; dlga_harald_meeting10_3:harald_meeting11|I see. May you be a slave to Sven Bull Neck like your mother. I despise you, {playername}, and you give me shame, but the Assembly forced us to work together. I will tell you as you have not heard.
; dlga_harald_meeting11:harald_meeting12|A woman travels with Sven Bull Neck. She is his seidr, one who accepts the spirit of the crow and speaks the words of Odin. Everybody reveres her, as she is a woman touched by the gods. Sven Bull Neck has married her in hopes of having a child touched by the gods, but she is old and her belly is dry. If she's your mother, I do not think she remembers you, as she has a curse that does not allow her to keep memories overnight.
dlga_harald_meeting12:harald_meeting13|Es sieht aus, als würde eure Mutter jetzt Sven Stiernacken dienen. Ich hoffe, ihr seid darauf vorbereitet euch damit zu befassen, wenn die Dinge hässlich werden.
dlga_harald_meeting13:harald_meeting13_1|Ich...
; dlga_harald_meeting13_1:harald_meeting13_2|--All around you, the sudden tumult and shouting of men drowns out your answer. A warrior bursts into the meeting. He is hot, and his eyes show panic.--
; dlga_harald_meeting13_2:harald_meeting13_3|Hersir Harald, sir! Sven Bull Neck has attacked us! Half the fleet is charging us! Thor help us, Sven has caught us unprepared.
; dlga_harald_meeting13_3:close_window|{s3}^^Captains, return to your ships and lead your crew. Sven Bull Neck will pay dearly for this attack. If we should lose this battle, remember to inform Rathbarth Ragnarsson about this betrayal by Sven Bull Neck. Good luck. Now, to battle!
; dlga_start:svenfinal_ld1|{playername}! My lord advised me that you'd come. Sven Bull Neck has taken Readingum and has many men with him, mainly Danish, who have sworn allegiance. They are tough, battle-hardened people, same as Sven, who is a legend. I would not like to be in the shoes of you or your men.
dlga_svenfinal_ld1:svenfinal_ld11|Ich hab keine Angst. Es ist Zeit zum kämpfen.
dlga_svenfinal_ld1:svenfinal_ld2|Wissen Sie ob eine Frau bei Ihm ist?
dlga_svenfinal_ld1:svenfinal_ld3|Wollen Sie nicht bleiben und kämpfen?
; dlga_svenfinal_ld2:svenfinal_ld11|You mean your mother, the seidr, right? Yes, she is with them. We saw her when she entered Readingum with Sven Bull Neck. I do not know how she was before, but now she is very gaunt and thin. I do not think she has long to live.
; dlga_svenfinal_ld3:svenfinal_ld11|I'm afraid not. My duties call me elsewhere. My role here was to make sure Sven Bull Neck would be here when you arrived. Apparently, my lord promised you this. He never breaks his word.
; dlga_svenfinal_ld11:close_window|Well, from what I've heard, you also are someone dangerous. I will leave the half a hundred men I promised my lord I would. They are brave warriors who have been promised a lot of gold to help you, so fight well. Farewell, {playername}, and good luck!

dlga_svenlair_2:svenlair_21|Noch ein neuer Sklavenhändler? Ich sehe schon. Nun, ich habe noch einige Sklaven.
dlga_svenlair_21:svenlair_42|Ich würde gerne diese Sklaven sehen.
; dlga_svenlair_21:svenlair_41|{playername}, to pay these men is to encourage them to keep attacking and enslaving people. We should make them pay dearly for the damage they do to people, not reward them for it!

; dlga_sven_comprapr:close_window|I don't have that kind of money. Farewell.
; dlga_sven_comprapr:close_window.1|I've thought about it and I am not buying them. I'm leaving.

dlga_pagano1_start:pagano1_action|{s4}
; dlga_cundwalh_historia:cundwalh_historial|That's right! Thanks to God, I am the best commander in Europe. My name has been long known and famous in all of Englaland, dog. I am a champion of West Seaxe. I have single-handedly killed twenty men in the chaos of war, and I have won over twenty battles since I started leading shield walls.
; dlga_cundwalh_historial:cundwalh_talk1|I've never, ever, suffered a defeat. You wish to learn from me, right? Then be good and listen to my words carefully tonight, or I will send one of my men to cut your throat with his seax.
dlga_cundwalh_talk1:cundwalh_historia1|Ja, ich bin interessiert.
dlga_cundwalh_talk1:lord_pretalk|Nein, habt Dank. Ich habe andere Dinge, die meine Aufmerksamkeit erfordern.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia1:cundwalh_historia2|I have good men, my beadupreat. They are ugly, stupid and cowardly, but they obey orders well. The first thing you need is men that obey orders without thinking too much.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia2:cundwalh_historia21|Then, you must teach them to advance in column. When they march this way, you travel the countryside without losing anybody. In battle, you must teach them to form ranks (by pressing F4 and F4) or squares (by pressing F4 and F7). It is easy to implement formations if you have a handy stick to beat the clumsy animal who may be unable to fit in properly.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia21:cundwalh_historia3|It is important that you know how to motivate your troops in battle. You can shout your barbaric war cry (by pressing the key T), which will undoubtedly scare away enemies surrounding you. You can always order your men to break the current formation (by pressing F4 and F8) so that they can properly charge into the enemy's lines.
dlga_cundwalh_historia3:cundwalh_historia4|Hmm, ich verstehe. Bitte fahrt fort.
dlga_cundwalh_historia3:lord_pretalk|Halt. Ich muss nichts mehr wissen. Wes gesund.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia4:cundwalh_historia41|Anyway, in my opinion ranks are crap better left to the dirty Welsh. If you really want to win a battle, pay attention! You must use Scildweall (by pressing F4 and F5) which forces your men to form a shield wall. We learned this tactic from the Romans, and a shield wall is a very cohesive tactic for our land. This formation is great, a true battle winner, and you should learn it well, dog. Scildweall will allow you to win your battles, fighting shoulder to shoulder with your men. You need to train it until you have sore knees and hands calloused by the use of the spear and shield. Get off your horse if you have one, and join your men, leading by example. When the enemy is broken and is fleeing, call your horse if it is still alive (by pressing h), mount it and charge the cowards, killing as many as you can to instill fear in your future enemies. You can also try to use the Wecg formation (by pressing F4 and F6) which will bring your men into forming a wedge shaped fighting body.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia41:cundwalh_historia5|Hear me. This formation is difficult to master, so you should use it only with veteran troops. It is designed to break an enemy's Scildweall, but when you use it, you must know that you are playing for all or nothing. It is a risky bet, for, if you fail, your enemies will earn your flank and kill your men as if they were nothing more than dry grass. My personal advice is to use Scildweall against Scildweall, always. No need to take risks, I say. You can give weapon orders, too, (by pressing F5 key) or the order to skirmish (by pressing F6). That is all, dog. Learn soon, and quickly, because if one day we are in the battlefield as enemies, I will kill you. Wes gesund.

; dlga_lord_collect_debt_no_pay:close_window|Is this a joke? I know full well that {s7} gave you the money, and I want every pening owed to me, {reg59?madam:sir}. As far as I'm concerned, I hold you personally in my debt until I see that silver.
; dlga_lord_start:close_window.1|I heard you got rid of that poxy merchant that was causing me so much grief. I can see you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh? I like that in a {reg59?woman:man}. Here's your reward. Remember, {playername}, stick with me and we'll go a long, long way together.
; dlga_lord_start:close_window.2|Oh, it's you. Enlighten me, how exactly does one lose a simple fight to some poxy, lowborn merchant? Truly, if I ever need my guardsmen to take a lesson in how to lie down and die, I'll be sure to come to you. Just leave me be, {playername}, I have things to do.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go|You! Do you have sawdust between your ears? Did you think that when I said to kill the merchant, I meant you to have a nice chat with him and then let him go? What possessed you?
dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2|Herr, ich habe dafür gesorgt, dass er nicht gegen euch arbeiten wird.
; dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2:lord_pretalk|Piffle. You were supposed to remove him, not give him a sermon and send him on his way. He had better do as you say, or you'll both regret it. Here, this is half the money I promised you. Don't say a word, {playername}. You're lucky to get even that. I have little use for {reg59?people:men} who cannot follow orders.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_completed|Beautiful work, {playername}! You captured both the spy and his handler, just as I'd hoped, and the two are now safely ensconced in my dungeon, waiting to be questioned. My torturer shall be busy tonight! Anyway, I'm very pleased with your success, {playername}, and I give you this purse as a token of my appreciation.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you! I wanted TWO prisoners, {playername} -- what you've brought me is one step short of useless! I already know everything the spy knows. It was the handler I was after. Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|I asked you for two prisoners, {playername}, not one. Two. Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler, the more important one of the pair. The spy will not dare return here and will prove quite useless to whatever master he served. 'Tis better than nothing. However, you'll understand if I pay you half the promised reward for what is but half a success.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you are nothing short of totally incompetent. Failing to capture both the spy AND his handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure. Forget any reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it.

dlga_lord_follow_spy_completed:lord_pretalk|Vielen Dank, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_failed:lord_pretalk|Hrm. Wie Sie wollen, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.2|Splendid work, {playername}. All the serfs are back, properly cowed, and they're busy preparing for the harvest. You certainly earned your reward. Here, take it, with my compliments.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed|{playername}. I have been waiting patiently for my serfs, yet none has returned. Have you an explanation? Were you outwitted by simple field hands, or are you merely incompetent? Or perhaps you are plotting with my enemies, intending to ruin me...
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a|Vergebt mir, {s65}. Diese Leibeigenen sind glitschig wie Aale.
; dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b|Perhaps if you had treated them better...
; dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Humph. That is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I need to recruit new men to work these fields before we all starve.
; dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b:close_window|Hah, now you reveal your true colours, traitor! Your words match your actions all too well. I should never have trusted you.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were three groups of serfs that I charged you to return. Three, not {reg17}. I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away. As for your reward, {playername}, I'll only pay you for the serfs you returned, not the ones you let fly. Here. Take it, and let this business be done.
; dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}. You are indeed generous.
; dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Bah, this proved to be a waste of my time.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_deal_with_bandits_completed|{playername}, I was told that you crushed the bandits at my village of {s5}. Please know that I am most grateful to you for that. Please, let me pay the expenses of your campaign. Here, I hope these {reg14} peningas will be adequate.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk|Not a problem, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.2|It was mere child's play.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.2|Damn it, {playername}. I heard that you were unable to drive off the bandits from my village of {s5}. Thanks to you, my village now lies in ruins. Everyone said that you were a capable warrior, but apparently, they were wrong.
; dlga_lord_start:ashdown_2petition|Ah, {playername}. You bring {reg13} head of cattle, as I requested. Thanks to you, we will soon be ready to move on the Saxons.

; dlga_lord_start:lord_scout_waypoints_thank|You make a good scout, {playername}. My runner just brought me your reports of the mission to {s13}, {s14} and {s15}. Well done.
; dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk|A simple task, {s65}.
; dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Nothing I couldn't handle.

; dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_accepted:close_window|Excellent! You know what to do, {playername}, now get to it. I need that cattle sooner rather than later.
; dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected:close_window|That... is unfortunate, {playername}. I shall have to find someone else who's up to the task. Please go now. I've work to do.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.3|Thank you for answering the summons, {playername}. However, as we are now at peace, we do not need your services. You may attend to your other business.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_report_to_army_asked|Ah, you have arrived at last, {playername}. We've been expecting you. I hope you have brought with you troops of sufficient number and experience.

; dlga_lord_report_to_army_completed:close_window|Excellent. We'll be moving soon. Now -- you are a {reg59?warrior:man} of sound judgment, and we trust that you will do what is necessary to support our campaign. I do not require you to remain close at hand, and I will not count it against you if you believe that your forces would be of better use elsewhere. But if you do choose to remain with me, to support me in battle, that would be appreciated. I may also have additional tasks for you to perform.

; dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints|{playername}, I need a volunteer to scout the area. We're sorely lacking on information, and I simply must have a better picture of the situation before we can proceed. I want you to go to {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and report back whatever you find.

; dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_accept|I accept your offer. I'll leave {s3} to you for {reg6} peningas.
; dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_deny|I fear I can't accept your offer.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge4:kinghorik_quest_revenge51|Thank you, King Horik. I brought with me Brunhild and Bodo. They are trustworthy.
dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge4:kinghorik_quest_revenge52|Lasst mich Euch meine Geschichte erzählen ...
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge51:kinghorik_quest_revenge52|Yes, yes, nice to meet them. Now, to the point. My time is limited.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge52:kinghorik_quest_revenge53|Recently, the boat I was traveling on was attacked by Vikings of Sven Bull Neck, a man of Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye.'
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge53:kinghorik_quest_revenge54|{s2}^^That is nothing special. Many jarls in Danmark have people who make themselves Vikings. Even the jarls and I were Vikings once. I hope you're not wasting my time... Choose your words carefully, or this conversation is over.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge54:kinghorik_quest_revenge61|Sven Bull Neck has captured my mother, and he has brought her to Sigurd.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge54:kinghorik_quest_revenge62|Sigurd tried to make the jarl of Kennemer king of Friese in exchange for an army.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge54:kinghorik_quest_revenge63|My companion Bodo had something important from the king of Asturias that Sigurd wanted.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge54:kinghorik_quest_revenge64|Sven Bull Neck has a hideout near Ribe, where he took the Woden Ric prisoners.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge54:kinghorik_quest_revenge65|Sven Bull Neck and Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' are up to something, and I want to stop them.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge61:kinghorik_quest_revenge21_2|{s2}^^Your mother? This is because Sigurd took your mother? You have wasted my time. I will not talk more. It's time for you to go.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge62:kinghorik_quest_revenge21_2|{s2}^^An army? This is your mystery? He is gathering men for Englaland, in the aid of my brothers. I myself have allowed my jarls and hersirs to join the expedition if they wish. Englaland is a rich land, inhabited by habitually weak people, waiting to be dominated and plundered by their betters. +You have wasted my time. I will not talk more. It's time for you to go.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge64:kinghorik_quest_revenge21_2|{s2}^^You tell me things I already know, and you do not interest me. My patience has a limit, and you have quickly reached it. +You have wasted my time. I will not talk more. It's time for you to go.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge21_2:close_window|Our meeting is over.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge65:kinghorik_quest_revenge55|Sven and Sigurd are hated and feared by many men. The question is if they are up to something that could affect me.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge55:kinghorik_quest_revenge61|Sven Bull Neck has my mother, and he has brought her to Sigurd.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge55:kinghorik_quest_revenge62|Sigurd tried to make the jarl of Kennemer king of Friese in exchange for an army.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge55:kinghorik_quest_revenge63|My companion Bodo had something important from the king of Asturias that Sigurd wanted.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge55:kinghorik_quest_revenge64|Sven Bull Neck has a hideout near Ribe, where he took the Woden Ric prisoners.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge63:kinghorik_quest_revenge67|I guess I can no longer maintain the secret, but this is not the place, nor are you the person. However, if I do not speak now, the danger is worse and could be terrible.^^The attack on the Woden Ric was no random act of piracy.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge67:kinghorik_quest_revenge68_1|My name is Bodo Vimaraniz from Malacoria, in Cantabria. I come from King Aldefonso of Asturias. I was sent north with a present for Aethelred, king of West Seaxe. This present and I are the reason Sven Bull Neck attacked the Woden Ric. Sigurd Ragnarsson wants this present for himself, because he wants to be the king of Danmark while his brothers are kings in Englaland.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge68_1:kinghorik_quest_revenge68|I know that Sigurd wants to be king. How could a gift give him my throne?
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge68:kinghorik_quest_revenge69|The Ragnarssons are powerful men, with lands in many places, like Danmark, Sweoland and now Northhymbre. Right now, it seems that their efforts are against Englaland, and they are, but this means ensuring that Danmark provide easy access to resources and warriors. If Sigurd is king here, he will guarantee all that. Moreover, now he can unite the Danish, for the gift I was carrying was the sword of Ragnar Lodbrok. His sons, Bjorn Ironside and Haesten, lost it when a Muslim fleet defeated them south of Al-Andalus.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge69:kinghorik_quest_revenge7|How did you get the sword from the Muslims?
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge69:kinghorik_quest_revenge7.1|Bodo, I'm impressed. You know a lot about the Danish. What are you not telling me?
dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge69:kinghorik_quest_revenge71|(Sagen Sie nichts)
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge7:kinghorik_quest_revenge71|It was a gift to my king made by the emir of Al-Andalus in exchange for valuable prisoners. Aethelred, king of West Seaxe, was very interested in this sword, and my king Aldefonso got it for him.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge7:kinghorik_quest_revenge71.1|I have been before in the north, but this is not important now.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge71:kinghorik_quest_revenge72|Ragnar was more than a man. The skalds revere him as god, and the men feed their souls with his legend. Sigurd could carry the sword to the Assembly and claim the merit of recovering it. He might demand to be king and even kill me, and everyone might just forgive him for having recovered his father's sword. Ragnar's sword must be destroyed before anyone knows it exists.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge72:kinghorik_quest_revenge73|Then maybe we can make a deal: sword for support.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge72:kinghorik_quest_revenge732|(Brunhild seems to want to say something. Let her.)
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge73:kinghorik_quest_revenge74|I have business with Sigurd and Sven. I want your protection and support when I need it.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge74:kinghorik_quest_revenge8|Yes, this is what we do. That sword cannot come to light, but we need to be cautious. Sigurd Ragnarsson is a shrewd man, and he won't attack openly. Go see him for the issues you mentioned to me and try to get the sword. I do not care if you steal it, buy it, or promise eternal loyalty, so long as he leaves it in your hands. What I want is that you bring me this sword to destroy. In return, when you bring the sword, you'll have my protection while in Danmark, and so I will proclaim, and Sigurd Ragnarsson will not dare to go against you. Now I must go. I've been too long with you, and I have other matters to attend to. Good luck and farewell.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge732:kinghorik_quest_revenge75|My king, it was I who told my companions to come to see you before we talk to Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye.' I know that he is a dangerous man, as I served in the house of the jarl of Kennemer. We ask for your protection and support for our cause, because {playername}'s mother is in the hands of Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' and Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge75:kinghorik_quest_revenge8|I understand, girl. You have my support, but I want Ragnar's sword. Sigurd will not kill you, so go talk to him. If you need to, tell him that you are under my protection. It is important that you succeed in giving me the sword. I do not care if you have to steal it, but bring it to me. Now I must go. I've been too long with you, and I have other matters to attend to. Good luck and farewell.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge8:kinghorik_quest_revenge81|{s2}^^{playername}, I have lied to the king. Well, it's not totally a lie. Everything is true except the existence of the sword. I know that the Danish give much importance to everything that has to do with Ragnar, and I used that. It was a risk, but we needed the king on our side. I hope you understand.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge81:kinghorik_quest_revenge82|The sword was important for getting the king's support. Thank you. Now, tell me the truth.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge81:kinghorik_quest_revenge84|No, Bodo! I don't know your game, but do not lie in the future. Now tell me the whole truth.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge81:kinghorik_quest_revenge84.1|Lying isn't tolerable, never lie again, Bodo, or I will take action against you. (Justice)
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge82:kinghorik_quest_revenge84|I disagree. How can we now justify to the king that there is no sword? Lying only brings problems. Everyone knows that. At least, everyone ought to know that.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge84:kinghorik_quest_revenge85|{s2}^^I am an honorable man. Honor is my law, but I owe allegiance to my king and to the mission that he entrusted to me. It took years of visiting this foreign land since the Rex Ordonio, father of current king of Asturias, sent me. This is hard to understand, but Asturias is a small kingdom, where every man must fight as a warrior or die at the hands of our enemies. We fight every year against the power of Al-Andalus. It is a constant front, and we thought our backs were safe until the Vikings arrived. Old King Ordonio, and now his son, King Aldefonso, want an alliance with Frankia and West Seaxe to protect ourselves from the Vikings and make the seas safer.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge85:kinghorik_quest_revenge86|I carried a letter sealed by my king himself for the king of West Seaxe. It is a letter of alliance that had to be sent in secret, lest it be intercepted. And I failed. The letter is now in the hands of Sigurd Ragnarsson, one of the men who tried to protect us. Do you understand the pity of it? Not so long ago his brothers, Bjorn Ironside and Halfdan, attacked Gallaecia, the western part of the Kingdom of Asturias.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge86:kinghorik_quest_revenge87|{playername}, Bodo isn't well, and we shouldn't lose more time here. It is time to talk to Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye.'
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge87:close_window|We're in rush now, but we'll talk about your mission later, Bodo. Now, let's go.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge87:close_window.1|Well, let's bother Bodo no more. We're looking for Sigurd.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot1|Sigurd Ragnarsson sent men to kill us at Ulf's farmstead.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot2|Sigurd promised to give me Sven and my mother at Ulf's farm, but we were attacked instead.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot2:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot1|Sigurd will not deliver up Sven Bull Neck, his best man. If you believed he would do such a thing, then you're dumber than I thought.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot1:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot3|My king, as you've asked me, I've been your eyes and ears. I know all the important information, because in {playername}'s camp there are no secrets. As you already know, {playername} is the one who broke Sigurd's plans to put a puppet on the throne of Friese. It was more likely an accident than a deliberate act, as {playername} is looking for Sven Bull Neck, Sigurd's first man, for revenge, because Sven has imprisoned {playername}'s mother. When {playername} talked to Sigurd, they agreed that, in exchange for Bodo the Cantabrian, Sigurd would deliver up Sven and {playername}'s mother at Ulf's farm.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot3:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot4|Yes, it is more or less what I expected.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot3:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot4.1|{s2}^^Yes, I heard that Sigurd holds Bodo prisoner. Bodo will be tortured, and when they finish, Sigurd will kill him and deliver his body to Njord.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot4:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot41|Egil, traitor, you're nothing but a spy!
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot4:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot5|--Do not say anything.--
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot41:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot42|{s2}^^I'm no traitor. I'm loyal to my king, and I'm helping you more than you think. King Horik has a network of informants in all locations, and he already knew about you, but especially Bodo, before you arrived.

There's a man in the court of Asturias willing to do anything to finish off their king, Aldefonso. Can you believe it? Although that kingdom is so far away, they have the same problems that we do!

He has gathered an army with the excuse of going to help his brothers in Englaland, but I fear he could use these men to take my throne if he gets favor in the Assembly. Now he has two options to play for such favor: first, Bodo's letter from the Kingdom of Asturias and second, Olvir White Hair's death.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot10:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot11|Our fates are crossed, {playername}. The soothsayers told me about you before you came. They said that a {reg59?woman:man} whose luck is greater than that of Sigurd would come, a {reg59?woman:man} who will save my throne.

If you aren't at the Assembly, you won't be able to defend yourself, so you will lose. Then the Assembly will banish you and put you outside the protection of the law. Any and every Dane is free to kill or otherwise mistreat such an outlaw, so, to the contrary, you very much need me if you wish to get your mother back and kill Sven. Now, listen to me.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot12:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot13|{s2}^^There is a man named Guthrum, who is a faithful man respected in Danmark. I will ask him to lead Sigurd's Vikings to provide support for the invasion of Englaland by the sons of Ragnar. However, my proposal will not succeed if Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' presents Bodo's letter in the Assembly or if he can associate me with the death of Olvir White Hair.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot13:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot14|Unfortunately, the letter has been hidden. My contacts say that Sigurd gave it to Atli Eiriksson, his second man after Sven Bull Neck. Atli sailed from Ribe some time ago, and no one knows his fate.

I didn't use Brunhild. We both had fun. It's her fault if she thought that it was something more. She should've known that someone like me will never marry, and certainly not a Frisian slave.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething3:kinghorik_quest_thething4|No matter, I think they are also awaiting your arrival, which means that maybe I should not have sent for you. I suspect they have some ploy to launch. Sigurd Ragnarsson has complained of 800 men who cannot board because I will not let him lead them. That much is true, because I proposed that Guthrum lead them. The problem is that Guthrum some days ago suffered the misfortune to have been killed on his farm. They accuse outlaws and criminals of burning down his house whilst he was hosting a feast inside. I think that it was Sven Bull Neck, the prow man of Sigurd's hird, who did it, but I have no evidence or witnesses. Everything and everyone was burned with the house.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething4:kinghorik_quest_thething5|Everything taken together, the situation is quite serious. Since Guthrum is dead, Sigurd is pushing hard to gain control of those 800 men. I fear he wishes to use them to take my throne.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething8:kinghorik_quest_thething81|{s2}^^Men of Danmark, you know me. When I was little more than a child, I was with Ragnar when he sacked Frankia with 120 ships and more than 4,000 men, an adventure that the skalds still relate. I am the man who led 400 Vikings in West Seaxe, the strongest kingdom in Englaland, to obtain great fame and wealth. Therefore, men fear me across Friese, Englaland, and Frankia, but here in Danmark, they rightfully respect and love me.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething81:kinghorik_quest_thething82|I had a brother, Olvir White Hair, a better man than me. He was a man of honor, loved by the gods, but in the prime of life, he was murdered. Now the king protects his murderer. I have never demanded anything of the Assembly, but now I call for justice. Is it right that his murderer be here, among us, or that a king protect evil? Shall murderers go unpunished in this land?^^{s2}
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething82:kinghorik_quest_thething83|{s2}^^It's what we expected. They use you to attack King Horik and undermine his authority.

This charge is very grave. The Assembly shall now listen to King Horik's response.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething85:kinghorik_quest_thething86|Sven insults me. I have never protected nor will ever protect a murderer. If that were what I was doing, it was in ignorance. {playername} came to me for protection as a free {reg59?lady:man}, and I gave it to {reg59?her:him} after {reg59?she:he} proved {reg59?her:his} worth.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething90:kinghorik_quest_thething90_1|My name is {playername}. Olvir White Hair tried to kill me at the behest of his brother, Sven Bull Neck. I was at peace on Ulf's farm, where I had gone by agreement with Sigurd Ragnarsson, present here today. Olvir White Hair came there with several men to try to kill me. As I always take strong issue with such a project, it was Olvir who died. I ask you, why did Sven send Olvir if he is the one who wants to get rid of me? I think it's because he fears me. Despite all of his bold words, he is in fact a coward who attacks defenseless ships and hides behind the cloak of his lord.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething91:kinghorik_quest_thething94|My name is {playername}, and I'm no murderer. Olvir's death was self-defense. Sven Bull Neck had kidnapped my mother, but Sigurd Ragnarsson promised to give her back to me at Ulf's farm. Instead, he sent Olvir White Hair to kill me.

My father, King Horik, is always concerned about what happens in this land. He compelled me to travel with {playername}. Olvir White Hair came with many men. I swear it was he who started the fight.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething11:kinghorik_quest_thething11_1|Unfortunately for you, I can show that you are a liar. Olvir did not die a good death, for the murderer has Olvir's sword. {reg59?She:He} did not let my brother hold the sword in his last moments, denying him Walhalla.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething20_1:kinghorik_quest_thethingdialogextend1|First of all, Reginhard's first master was Thiaderd, not the jarl of Kennemer. (Persuasion)
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thethingdialogextend1:kinghorik_quest_thething20_2|Reginhard betrayed his first master, Thiaderd, as now he betrays me. Would any man keep a known enemy in his hird? This man has just demonstrated that he cannot be trusted.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething20_3:kinghorik_quest_thething20_4|What? I was in {playername}'s hird, too, and I swear to the gods that these men lie. I demand a death duel against them if they allege these things.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething20_7:kinghorik_quest_thething20_2|Silence! We do not tolerate anyone making a mockery of this Assembly.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething20_2:kinghorik_quest_thething21|Now, this is a very delicate matter that may affect the stability of the kingdom. The judges shall retire to deliberate for a moment.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething21:kinghorik_quest_thething22|-- You watch as the judges get behind the big rock before entering a heated discussion. All around you, everyone engages in energetic conversations. Some jarls support King Horik; others Jarl Sigurd Ragnarsson. This Assembly may either be the solution to civil war or the trigger to start one. Everything depends on the judges' decision.^^You realize that no one approaches you; everyone avoids you like the plague. You are aware also that nobody gave you the opportunity to present the case of the abduction of your mother. You feel you have not been more than a piece in a game of Hneftalf between the powerful men of Danmark. --
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething22:kinghorik_quest_thething23|-- The judges are slow to come to a decision. You're not sure how much time has passed, but it seems it takes them very, very long. Many men around you have decided to sit on the ground, and there are even merchants distributing food and mead. Reginhard remains in the same spot, silent and without moving a muscle, as if carved in granite. Egil doesn't look at you, either. He is among the men around King Horik, advising and encouraging him.^^Finally, the judges return from behind the large rock. --

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething29_2:kinghorik_quest_thething30|We, the members of {reg59?her:his} hird, will pay this wergild, in order that {playername} may remain free to continue leading us.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething30:kinghorik_quest_thething31|Then the Assembly accepts the money and gives it to Sven Bull Neck. The price for spilt blood has been satisfied. Before gods and men, this quarrel has ended between these two men.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething30_2:kinghorik_quest_thething31|Well, the Assembly has spoken. Before gods and men, this quarrel has ended between these two men.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething31:kinghorik_quest_thething31_2|Odin, Thor and Frey have heard what is here decided. May they punish any who do not fulfill their oaths.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething31_2:kinghorik_quest_thething33|Regarding the case of the witness called Reginhard, who has been accused of lying, the gods must decide his culpability. As the accusation is grave, this Assembly has decided that {playername} and Reginhard will engage in a holmgang, a duel to the death, on the island called Short, within six days. Two will go, but only one return. If one of them fails to show up, {reg59?he or she:he} will be declared nithingr, coward, less than a man, and this will be told by skalds and messengers to all men in Danmark and abroad.

Moreover, you are agreeing with Reginhard, who has betrayed us. I argue that Reginhard is a liar, and if you do not face him, giving the reason, I say that you're a liar too.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33_2:kinghorik_quest_thething33_3|The decisions of the Assembly cannot be gainsaid. They are backed by the gods and the free men of Danmark. The sentence is a duel to discover the lie. {playername}, you must choose: fight against Reginhard or defend him against Egil.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33_3:kinghorik_quest_thething33_4|I will fight against Reginhard.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33_7:kinghorik_quest_thething34|This Assembly has also decided on a last major issue. The accusations and insults between King Horik and Jarl Sigurd can cause serious damage to Danmark. Therefore, this assembly of free men, which is above jarls and kings and answers only to the gods, has decided that a reconciliation between the two must occur. King Horik will give Jarl Sigurd a position on his council and among his most beloved men. Moreover, King Horik will pay 15.000 peningas in compensation for all the efforts made by the Sigurd in organizing the expedition.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething34:kinghorik_quest_thething35|{s2}^^In return, Jarl Sigurd shall remain by King Horik, advising him and not leaving Danmark. Therefore, Jarl Sigurd Ragnarsson must relinquish control over the fleet that shall relieve his brethren. This fleet will be lead by two other men: Sven Bull Neck, on the part of Jarl Sigurd, and Harald Haraldsson, on the part of King Horik. The fleet will depart for Englaland in a few days without further delay.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething35:kinghorik_quest_thething36_1|It is furthermore our decision that {playername} shall join as advisor of Harald Haraldsson, as long as the gods give {reg59?her:him} the victory in the holmgang. Otherwise, Egil takes {playername}'s place and hird. One or the other should meet with me in the mead hall of Ribe once the holmgang is over.

; dlga_alfredthegreat42:alfredthegreat5|{s2}^^The Danish want to meet with us to negotiate the terms of their retreat. Thank you for the information about their weakness, but I think we are still interested in this deal.
; dlga_alfredthegreat43:alfredthegreat5|{s2}^^While I admire your loyalty to your masters, do not treat me like a fool. We have received news of the disaster of the fleet sent from Danmark, and in the north, the Danish have many problems with Picts. However, we have our own problems right now, so this deal is good for us.

; dlga_ragnarssons_7:ragnarssons_8|Your bother, Bjorn, sent me to inform you that the reinforcements from Danmark are lost because Sven Bull Neck turned his men against the rest. There will be no reinforcements. Bjorn Ironside wants to convene a meeting with the Saxon and Mercian leaders to restore Snotingaham to them in exchange for them letting you back north with your armies.^^This seax, which belonged to Ragnar, certifies that I come from your brother and speak the truth.
; dlga_ragnarssons_8:ragnarssons_9|Damn Bjorn! He's old and had his glory, but now begrudges us ours. The Saxons and the Angles are weak peoples. If it were me, I would attack their camps and put them to flight like the mice they are.

I am Ivar Ragnarsson. Men call me Inn Beinlaussi, the Boneless.

; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge2:sigurd_quest_revenge32|I did not know the jarl's plans, so I defended Doccinga. I am loyal to your cause.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge31:sigurd_quest_revenge4|How stupid can you be? Sven Bull Neck is not just any man but my favorite, the man who stands in the prow of my own personal ship. You and I have nothing to talk about. Get out now, while my obligation to hear you in peace still weighs down my sword.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge32:sigurd_quest_revenge322|Your loyalty is too strange and too late. You're just the rat that thwarted my plans in Friese. {s4} had promised me six hundred men for the expedition to Englaland. Now I have exactly none.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge322:sigurd_quest_revenge31|Sorry, but I just want to know where Sven Bull Neck is.
dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge322:sigurd_quest_revenge33|Ich werde 600 Mann für dich rekrutieren!
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge33:lord_pretalk|{s4}^^I do hope you're not teasing me and that it is not Loki speaking with your mouth. Frankly, I doubt you're able to recruit six hundred men, but if you recruit more than two hundred, come back here, and we will talk. Maybe you will get to chat with my friend, Sven.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_collect1:sigurd_quest_collect1|{s2}^^One of my hersirs will take care of your men. Well, now they are MY men. I really did not expect someone like you to be able to do this, but here you are. I see that you will do anything to find Sven Bull Neck and your mother.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_collect1:sigurd_quest_collect2|Yes. Sven Bull Neck attacked the ship on which I was traveling and kidnapped my mother. He had mistaken the person because of an object she was carrying. Sven Bull Neck has to pay for this, and I must rescue my mother.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_collect2:sigurd_quest_revenge5|Your mother is the woman touched by the gods? Yes, Sven brought her to me, as I had asked. She was carrying an object, a letter from overseas that had to be intercepted. I talked to her, yes... She spoke about a man called Bodo, who had given her the letter on a ship called the Woden Ric. So do you know that name?
dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge4:sigurd_quest_revenge41|{s10}
dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge41:sigurd_quest_revenge5|{s4}
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge5:sigurd_quest_revenge51|No, I do not know who he is. Should I?
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge5:sigurd_quest_revenge52|Yes, he was also traveling in the Woden Ric.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge51:sigurd_quest_revenge6|Lying! Why do you lie? You say that you traveled on the same boat with your mother, and she says she met Bodo on the same boat. That man, Bodo, is very important to me, but Sven made the mistake of leaving him in his hideout. Now Bodo is gone because someone rescued him. I suspect I know who this someone is! Bodo is so important, that I would gladly trade him for Sven Bull Neck and you mother, who still lives only because Sven has taken a liking to her.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge52:sigurd_quest_revenge6|I know, your mother told me. That man, Bodo, is very important to me, but Sven made the mistake of leaving him in his hideout. Now Bodo is gone because someone rescued him. I suspect I know who this someone is! Bodo is so important, that I would gladly trade him for Sven Bull Neck and you mother, who still lives only because Sven has taken a liking to her.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge6:sigurd_quest_revenge61|You tell me where Sven Bull Neck and my mother are, and Bodo is yours.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge6:sigurd_quest_revenge62|I do not know where Bodo is.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge61:sigurd_quest_revenge71|Then we have a deal. I suppose Bodo is with you, so I will send two men to get him. You people keep quiet, for I have hundreds of warriors ready to attack on my order. If they take Bodo without complications, there will be no problems. I hope this will be how it goes, for a fight would not benefit any of us.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge71:sigurd_quest_revenge8|{s4}^^As for my part, there is a farm near Skyfa belonging to a man that is loyal to me. Go there, and Sven Bull Neck and your mother will meet you there. {playername}, remember that there are laws in Danmark, and if you cause any damage to Sven, you will have to pay...
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge62:sigurd_quest_revenge72|I'm too old to swallow your lies. Bodo means too much to me, and I know you know where he is. What I do not know is if you have hidden him among your people or elsewhere. So here is the deal:
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge72:sigurd_quest_revenge82|{s4}^^There is a farm near Skyfa belonging to a man that is loyal to me. Go there, and Sven Bull Neck and your mother will meet you there. If Bodo is there, my men will exchange Sven Bull Neck and your mother for him. If Bodo is not there, your mother will die before your eyes, and I will send Sven away to a place where you will never find him.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge8:close_window|Have your men follow me. I will tell Bodo farewell and give him to them.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge82:sigurd_quest_revenge82_1|I will go to that farm near Skyfa. Farewell.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge82_1:close_window|Well, I think we have nothing to talk about.
; dlga_lord_talk:sigurd_story1|I would like to know more about you.
; dlga_sigurd_story1:lord_pretalk|My name is Sigurdr ormr i auga, Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye,' son of Ragnar Lodbrok and Aslaug, lord of Sjaelland, Skane, and other lands. To learn more, ask other men, as fame is measured by what others say about you.
; dlga_lord_talk:kennemerjarl_story1|I would like to know more about you.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_story1:lord_pretalk|There is not much to tell you. I am the son of Harald the Younger and nephew of King Horik. My father with my uncle and Gotrik conquered this land.^One may say that my uncle Hrorik, the king, serves Lothar, king of the Franks, but really, my uncle does what he wants. The only thing is that we should not attack the land of the Franks. This I heed very little, and occasionally I organize some expedition for plunder or pay against the Franks.^^There is no need to talk over my head, and there are more pressing problems, such as the rebellion of some Frisians. My uncle would sooner kill them all, but he is still too weak.
; dlga_lord_talk:kennemerjarl_1|{s11}, Thonkrik from Doccinga told me that you could help me.
; dlga_king_doccingacano:lord_pretalk|I sent men there weeks ago. I will try to send more men soon, but I need to gain time. If you help Doccinga, I will be grateful.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_doccingacano:lord_pretalk|That's neither my problem nor yours. It is the king's problem.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_1:kennemerjarl_2|Thonkrik is a good man, and you are a good friend. What do you need?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_1:kennemerjarl_2.1|Thonkrik is a good man, one of the few Frisians who have gained my esteem. If you come in his name, I will listen to you!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_2:kennemerjarl_3|Do you know the Woden Ric? I traveled on this ship with my mother, but we were attacked by Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_3:kennemerjarl_4|Sven the Bloody attacks merchant ships near our shores, waiting for us to pay him every spring, but not this year! Do not worry. I'm gathering troops to hunt for him. Now, I have things to do...
; dlga_kennemerjarl_4:kennemerjarl_51|I desire to join the hunt. My goal is to avenge the death of my mother.
dlga_kennemerjarl_4:kennemerjarl_52|{s10}
dlga_kennemerjarl_52:kennemerjarl_6|{s2}
; dlga_kennemerjarl_51:kennemerjarl_6|{s1}^^I am not sure... How many men and ships do you have?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_6:kennemerjarl_71|My arms are my men, and my courage is my ships. Together we will kill Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_6:kennemerjarl_72|In truth, I lost everything, but I do not lack the courage to achieve my revenge.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_6:kennemerjarl_73|I am just one {reg59?woman:man}, sir, but I will give my eternal loyalty to you.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_71:kennemerjarl_8|Yes, yes, I see... Well, look, I'm very busy. Why don't you come see me later? In ten years, for example?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_72:kennemerjarl_8|Well, I understand your desire for revenge, but I cannot help you... I need men and ships ready to fight, not desperate, poorly equipped orphans-in-mourning.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_73:kennemerjarl_8|Your loyalty does not interest me. Tell you what... You look like a good {reg59?woman:man}. Why not ask Thonkrik from Doccinga for {reg59?a good man to marry:a job digging the moat} and try to rebuild your life?
dlga_kennemerjarl_8:kennemerjarl_91|{s10}
; dlga_kennemerjarl_8:kennemerjarl_92|I thought that surely you would understand the demands of honor in cases such as mine.
dlga_kennemerjarl_91:kennemerjarl_92|{s2}
; dlga_kennemerjarl_92:kennemerjarl_93|Are you indeed so motivated by honor? Alright, I can do this: I'll give you a place among the men who will face Sven if you prove your worth.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_93:kennemerjarl_94|{s1}^^There is a problem I need to solve. Not far from here is a monastery of Christians, Odin damn them, who have sent a request to intercede in a land property dispute.^Honestly, I care very little about their problems, but the king wants Christian priests happy, to avoid Frisian rebellions.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_94:kennemerjarl_95|Anyway, my men are busy, protecting important things like the people on the coast, so you go in my name and make the arrangement that best suits my interests.^The most important thing is to keep the monks quiet. I do not want them stirring up the people versus rightful Danish dominion.
dlga_kennemerjarl_95:kennemerjarl_10|Habt Dank, mein Fürst. Ich wird euch nicht enttäuschen.
dlga_kennemerjarl_95:kennemerjarl_10.1|Gibt es eine Belohnung?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_95:kennemerjarl_10.2|It will be done quickly. Farewell.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_10:lord_pretalk|Are you still here, {reg59?woman:man}? You have a mission! Complete it, and your revenge on Sven will be that much closer. Now, get out!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_1:kennemerjarl_juicio_3|Yes, I know. The monastery sent a messenger with the news. They are happy with your decision and promise to speak well of me to the people. Take this reward, and thank you!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_2:kennemerjarl_juicio_4|Yes, I know. The monastery sent a messenger with the news. They are very unhappy and blame me for sending you. They say that everyone will know that I am unjust! Damn you!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_3:kennemerjarl_juicio_5|What about our deal? May I join the hunt now?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_4:kennemerjarl_juicio_41|No one can think that you are unfair when justice has been done.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_41:kennemerjarl_juicio_42|Oho! A {reg59?lady:gentleman} with values. Justice is all very nice, but this world isn't right and won't recognize it. That land wasn't important, but good relations with monastery are. Do not upset me again.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_42:kennemerjarl_juicio_5|What about our deal? May I join the hunt now?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_5:kennemerjarl_juicio_6_old|Err, not just yet. Now I need you to do something else to prove your worth, this time as a warrior. There is a rebellious Frisian, called Thiaderd, who has been causing me a headache, and I do not have the time right now to take care of him.^^I'll give you permission to recruit on my land. Also, I will send a letter to the king so he may likewise allow you to recruit men in Friese.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_6_old:kennemerjarl_juicio_6_final|This is what I want you to do. Take this silver and recruit fifteen men. The cheapest are village idlers or refugees at the monastery. Sometimes spare men are available at farmsteads. Once you have men, come back here, and I will tell you how to find Thiaderd.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_6_final:lord_pretalk|--He scratches his nose--^^Well, good luck. Now, you have things to do.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_recruit_back1:kennemerjarl_juicio_6_new|Well, you again have proven useful. As I mentioned before, there is a rebellious Frisian called Thiaderd who has been a headache for me. I do not have the time right now to take care of him. You'll do it for me!^^Oh, and here is some money to equip yourself better. I can't allow people to think that I employ such shabby help.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_6_new:kennemerjarl_juicio_61|I like the sound of this.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_6_new:kennemerjarl_juicio_61.1|I do not like what you offer.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_61:kennemerjarl_juicio_7|To tell you the truth, I don't care if you like it or not. You offered your services, and I offered you a job.^Do this for me, and your revenge upon Sven will be closer. Take this money and travel to Dorestad. There is a man there who knows all about this. His name is Reginhard, and I hear that he cowers in the mead hall between the prostitutes and the other drunks.^He would not talk to my men, but maybe you can find out where the rebel is hiding and kill him. Thiaderd must die.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_7:kennemerjarl_juicio_71|It shall be done. Farewell.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_7:kennemerjarl_juicio_71.1|I do not like this mission, but I keep my part of the deal. Farewell.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_71:kennemerjarl_juicio_71_fin|Are you still here? You have a mission! I would see you on it, {reg59?madame:sir}!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_71_fin:lord_pretalk|--He scratches his nose--
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm1:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm2|I am very happy. The news of Thiaderd's death came before you.^^I must say that I doubted your abilities, but certainly you're smarter than I thought. Moreover, you have proven to be someone trustworthy and loyal. Take this money as compensation for your efforts. It is a pity that you didn't kill Reginhard, too, but I guess you need a pet in your party. However, I do not want him around me, so keep that rat away when you come to see me.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm2:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm3|{s2}^^Well, well... I must confess something. I've been waiting for someone like you for a long time. You are a person that can find solutions and accomplish what is ordered. That is very important. Sometimes I feel like I'm surrounded by dolts.^^Now, there is a delicate subject I want to talk to you about -- one that can make you rich.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm3:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm41|Wealth, I do not care about. I just want Sven.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm3:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm42|I like what I hear! Please continue...
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm41:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm42|That much I know! But the two are related. Listen to the whole story and see for yourself.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm42:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm5|To be honest, I have the men to hunt Sven, who's near Doccinga. I'm hoping that you'll join us in his capture...^However, we have a problem: the king. The king, my uncle, does not want to attack Sven Bull Neck. He fears his master, Jarl Sigurd, called 'Snake in the Eye,' one of the oldest sons of Ragnar, called Lodbrok in Norse -- Hairy Breeches.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm5:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm52|These names say nothing to me. Who are Sigurd and his father, Ragnar? Should I fear them?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm5:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm51|You have kept all this information hidden until now?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm5:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm6|I am listening. Please continue.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm51:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm6|You must understand, it is not so easy. It is a sensitive issue, and you were a stranger that the sea had just brought to us. Now it's different. I think you're someone I can trust.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm52:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm5|Ragnar Sigurdsson was a man who became a legend, a king who ruled part of Danmark and whose ships caused fear wherever they were spotted. Ragnar died years ago, but he had many sons, many of whom are invading Englaland right now.^Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' Ragnarsson is one of his oldest sons, by the princess Aslaug. He is old now, but still a man to be feared and a respected Danish jarl.^Yes, you should fear him if you do not have the support of a powerful king or jarl. I can be that man if you help me.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm6:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm7|Here is the deal: kill my uncle {s10}, and I will take the kingdom for myself. Then I'll have the necessary resources and men to hunt Sven Bull Neck and attack his master, Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye.' Additionally, I will give you the title of 'jarl' in this land, plus the men and money to be powerful.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm7:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm71|You want to become king, using me? No, I don't trust you! I am not your assassin!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm7:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm71.1|We had a deal. Thiaderd is dead. Your part is to give me what I need to hunt Sven.
dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm7:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm74|{s10}
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm7:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm9|I accept your proposal. I will kill your king.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm71:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm8|No more deals, lies or missions! Just this one condition, and everything will be yours. What is your answer?
dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm74:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm8|{s2}
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm8:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm9|I accept. I will kill {s10}.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm8:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm91|No, you will have to find another assassin. I will hunt Sven Bull Neck on my own.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm9:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm9a|I was sure I would hear that answer, for I have not misled you. {s10} is not just any man. Everyone fears him, not the least because he is always accompanied by an escort of faithful warriors. His death should be public, in the sight of those who fear him. The ideal time would be during a feast. I do not care if you use poison or a dagger, but two things are very important...
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm9a:kennemerjarl_salida|Firstly, if you are caught, do not mention my name. You must appear to be acting alone. Even beforehand, we should not be seen together. If we happen to meet, we must pretend not to know each other.^^Secondly and more importantly, do not get caught!^^Once you are done, do not come here. Hide in the mountains, where Thiaderd's camp was, and I will send for you when things are calm and I am the king. Now go and make me king.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm91:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm91a|You're dumber than I thought. It's quite beyond you, with your resources, to find Sven. Even if you do, he will kill you easily. If you decide to change your mind, remember this: {s10} must die in public, in the sight of those who fear him, ideally at a feast. I do not care if you use poison or a dagger, but two things are very important...

Otherwise, you will have to face the consequences.
dlga_kennemerjarl_salida:lord_pretalk|Sehr gut.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_enemistad1:kennemerjarl_enemistad2|Beware, Jarl! Those were Sven's men. You are the traitor, and I am your enemy now.
dlga_kennemerjarl_enemistad1:kennemerjarl_enemistad3|{s10}
; dlga_kennemerjarl_enemistad1:kennemerjarl_enemistad4|I have served you well. In return, you lied to me about Sven, and now you threaten me.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_enemistad2:kennemerjarl_enemistad21|Yes, I'm sure of that. To honor services provided, I will give you a few hours to pack your things and leave. Then you will have assassins after you, for I will put a price on your head. You'll have to sleep with one eye open and a knife under your pillow.^If you do not leave Friese or we meet in person, I will kill you with my bare hands.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_enemistad4:kennemerjarl_enemistad21|Yes. These men were going to take and fortify the village, then wait for more troops from Danmark. Now that's impossible. You've ended my dreams. Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' will think I'm a traitor and will want my head because of you. Go away! You're no longer welcome here. If we meet again, I do not know if I will be able to control myself and not kill you.^^I recommend you leave Friese.

; dlga_frisaking_5:lord_pretalk|Well, you look like a resolute {reg59?woman:man}. Maybe you can help me with problems in Doccinga. Go and investigate what is happening for me. When you come back, we'll talk about feasts.
; dlga_frisaking_5:lord_pretalk.1|Well, you look like a resolute {reg59?woman:man}. Maybe you can help me with Doccinga. Go and help defend the village. When you come back, we'll talk about feasts.
; dlga_frisaking_4:lord_pretalk|You accuse one of my dearest jarls of treason? I see. Someone is trying to create problems with my jarls and sends me a stranger with rumors. Perhaps they think that I'm an idiot and that I will give credibility to these hoaxes? Listen carefully, rat. Your word is not worth anything. Only evidence is important. Now, get the hell out, and give thanks that I do not separate your head from your neck.
; dlga_jarldenunciado1:jarldenunciado12|Heill, {playername}! I heard about your help to Doccinga. Thank you for your support, vinr. The attack was unexpected, and I did not have my men ready. Please, accept these gifts for your courage.

; dlga_jarldenunciado14:jarldenunciado15|Sven Bull Neck is the dog of Jarl Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye,' one of the oldest sons of Ragnar Lodbrok. You're talking about very feared and dangerous people, {playername}. My nephew is reckless and daring, and our kingdom is at a difficult moment with Frisian revolts. He thinks I'm weak for not exterminating the Frisians and attacking the Franks who support them. In fact, we aren't as strong now as in the past. However, I don't think he is a traitor. Do you have evidence?
; dlga_jarldenunciado15:jarldenunciado16|No, but he asked me to kill you.

dlga_kinghorik_quest_atlieiriksson1:kinghorik_quest_atlieiriksson2|Das sind gute Neuigkeiten. Wo war er?
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_atlieiriksson2:kinghorik_quest_atlieiriksson3|We found Atli Eiriksson and his men in a cave in Northvegr, near Hordaland. Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' sent him there to hide and protect Bodo's letter. Now Atli Eiriksson and his men are dead, but they burned the letter during the fighting. You no longer have to fear that Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' can use it against you at the Assembly.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_atlieiriksson3:kinghorik_quest_atlieiriksson4|Atli is dead? He was Sigurd Ragnarsson's second man, after Sven Bull Neck. Wherever you go, you leave just corpses. I wanted Sigurd quiet, with no weapons to use against me, nor motives for revenge. I hope you killed everybody in that cave, or he may present as a witness against you for killing Atli. I will not be able to protect you from banishment in that case.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_atlieiriksson6:lord_pretalk|Well, the important thing is that the letter has been destroyed. Finish what you have to do before the Assembly.
dlga_kinghorik_ulf_testigo1:kinghorik_ulf_testigo2|Schön das zu hören. Hast du deine Beziehung mit den Jarls vom Königreich verbessert?^^--Current good relations:^{s2}--
dlga_kinghorik_ulf_testigo2:kinghorik_ulf_testigo31|Ich tat, was ich konnte.
dlga_kinghorik_ulf_testigo2:kinghorik_ulf_testigo32|Nein. Ich brauche mehr Zeit. Ich möchte noch meine Beziehungen mit den Edlen verbessern.
; dlga_kinghorik_ulf_testigo32:lord_pretalk|Well, do what you must and return when ready. But do not take too long, as the Assembly will start shortly.
; dlga_kinghorik_ulf_testigo31:lord_pretalk|Well, frankly I'm surprised at how effective you've been. When you're ready for the Assembly, let me know.
; dlga_kinghorik_thething1:kinghorik_thething2|I see. In that case, now everything is in the hands of the gods. The Assembly lasts several days. I recommend you take advantage of these days to gain popularity and reputation with the people of this country.
; dlga_kinghorik_thething2:lord_pretalk|I'll send a messenger as soon as your presence is required. Be ready.
; dlga_jarlbjornnegtruce_1:jarlbjornnegtruce_2|That is good news! We will negotiate a withdrawal with them now, but in the future, we will return and make West Seaxe pay dearly for their weakness. You've done a great service to me and my brothers. Allow me to reward you with friendship and silver.
dlga_jarlbjornnegtruce_2:jarlbjornnegtruce_3|Was mich angeht sind wir fertig. Ihr solltet zu Rathbarth zurückkehren.
dlga_jarlbjornnegtruce_3:lord_pretalk|Sehr gut.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_1:jarlbjornneg_2|I can imagine that Halfdan imposed his opinion. I had hoped to be mindful of his reasons and I'm glad I did so.^^Now it is necessary to contact the Saxons. I have prepared a letter for them where we offer a truce to cover our retreat to Northhymbre and to summon them to a meeting outside Snotingaham's gate to discuss the details.^^My informants tell me that one of the Saxon chieftains, Aelfred, patrols around Snotingaham every day. Meet with him and give him my letter.
dlga_jarlbjornneg_2:jarlbjornneg_31|Wer ist Aelfred?
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_2:jarlbjornneg_32|Why not take the letter to the Mercians? We are in their kingdom.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_2:jarlbjornneg_33|The king of West Seaxe is Aethelred. Why not give the letter to him?
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_31:jarlbjornneg_4|Aelfred, or I should say Aetheling Aelfred Aethelwulfing, is the brother of West Seaxe's king. I have heard that he is a just man and easier to deal with than his brother. Moreover, his opinion carries great weight among the Saxon jarls.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_32:jarlbjornneg_4|Do not kid yourself. The Saxons are the real power here. The Angles of Mierce are very weak. Without the support of West Seaxe, Mierce would be under our feet by now. It will be the Saxons who make the decision to accept the ceasefire or not, and in this case, Aelfred is our man. He is more reasonable than his brother.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_33:jarlbjornneg_4|Aethelred is a warrior, and we need a diplomat. Anyway, in such matters he seeks advice from his brother, Aelfred.
dlga_jarlbjornneg_4:jarlbjornneg_51|Wir sind bald zurück.
dlga_jarlbjornneg_4:jarlbjornneg_52|Hmpf. Ich erwarte eine Belohnung für meine Dienste.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_51:lord_pretalk|Remember this: when you get to Snotingaham, introduce yourself as a peace emissary from the sons of Ragnar and ask for audience with Aelfred. Tell him we're willing to an honorable way out of this siege without bloodshed, and we are willing to meet at the gates of Snotingaham to address this issue.^^Be firm! Tell him only that we are willing to negotiate, or we will bring more men from the north, and they will pay dearly in lives of Saxons and Mercians. Good luck.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_52:jarlbjornneg_51|Yes, I quite forgot I was talking to a merchant. I usually reward my faithful with silver as a symbol of our bond, but I understand that you are not that kind of person. Well, here's your prize, and there will be more if you complete your task. Now...
dlga_jarlbjorn_1:jarlbjorn_2|\nMein Bruder, Sigurd, versprach uns tausend Mann. Wo sind sie?
; dlga_jarlbjorn_2:jarlbjorn_3|They are dead or lost. Sigurd Ragnarsson, under orders of the Assembly, sent a fleet led by Sven Bull Neck and Harald Haraldsson, but Sven pitted his followers against the followers of Harald, and there was a massacre. I fear that Harald's followers are all dead but me, and Sven's are severely depleted.
; dlga_jarlbjorn_3:jarlbjorn_4|{s2}^^Sven was always difficult to handle, so I never understood Sigurd's predilection for him. Now this puts us in a difficult situation here in Snotingaham. If I ever meet Sven again, I will kill him with my bare hands. We are at a disadvantage compared to the men of West Seaxe and Mierce. So far, we have managed to keep them at bay thanks to our reputation, but every day they become more daring and eventually will storm Snotingaham. Then all will be lost. We have to restore their fear in order to make a deal that will let our people escape Snotingaham. Without reinforcements, retreat is the only option.
; dlga_jarlbjorn_4:jarlbjorn_5_1|I thought Englaland would be an easy target for a Viking army.
dlga_jarlbjorn_4:jarlbjorn_5_2|{s10}
; dlga_jarlbjorn_5_1:jarlbjorn_5_3|West Seaxe and Mierce are two powerful kingdoms, which makes nothing easy. We need many more men before facing them, especially now that both kings have united against us. Luckily, these alliances are fleeting. If we retreat now and focus our interest on weaker kingdoms, there will be another opportunity to go against Mierce or even West Seaxe. For now, there's always Pictland, poor, stony prospect though it be!
dlga_jarlbjorn_5_3:jarlbjorn_5_2|{s10}
dlga_jarlbjorn_5_2:jarlbjorn_6|{s4}
; dlga_jarlbjorn_6:jarlbjorn_7|This land is rich, and its people fear us. That fear is what now keeps them from attacking us, but they are losing it. We must regain the initiative.^^West Seaxe, especially, has become very bold, and Saxon foragers even get close to our lines. There is a group there now, around Snotingaham. I want you to go and punish them. This will send a clear message to our enemies and undermine their confidence.
; dlga_jarlbjorn_7:jarlbjorn_9|I see. Very well, I'll take care of them.
dlga_jarlbjorn_7:jarlbjorn_8|Warum sollte ich das machen?
; dlga_jarlbjorn_8:jarlbjorn_9|Because you have come to reinforce this army. I am the chief here, and I give you an order.

; dlga_jarlbjorn_9_pre:lord_pretalk|I always reward warriors who do their job well.
; dlga_jarlbjornwf_1:jarlbjornwf_2|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those foragers the punishment they deserved. You are really as good as I had guessed. Here is your reward: 900 peningas.
; dlga_jarlbjornwf_2:jarlbjornwf_3|I think you're someone who knows how to do things. It's time to take another step. I want you to pass through the enemy lines and take a message to my brothers. Tell them about the betrayal of Sven and that we will not have reinforcements from Danmark. Tell them I'm going to arrange a meeting with the Saxons to negotiate our retreat from Snotingaham.
dlga_jarlbjornwf_3:jarlbjornwf_4|Ich gehe jetzt.
; dlga_jarlbjornwf_3:jarlbjornwf_4_1|Why would your brothers believe me and accept surrender?
; dlga_jarlbjornwf_4_1:jarlbjornwf_4|Because I'll give you an object that they will recognize and give validity to you as my envoy to them. I am Bjorn, of the sons of Ragnar, and my brothers listen to what I say. Do not worry. They will listen to and respect you.
; dlga_jarlbjornwf_4:close_window|Wait. I'm going to give you a seax that belonged to our father, Ragnar. This is also my gift to you for the service you're providing to us. My brothers will recognize the weapon and listen to your words. The Mercians are more careless in their vigilance. Try to approach at night around their flank. Good luck.
; dlga_raethbarth_1:raethbarth_2|Judging by your face, I'm afraid the news is not good, but please speak.
; dlga_raethbarth_2:raethbarth_3|I have bad news about the Vikings sent from Danmark in support of the Ragnarssons' invasion of Mercia. The fleet initially consisted of 30 boats and about 800 men, but Sven Bull Neck pitted his followers against the followers of Harald Haraldsson, and there was a massacre. I fear that Sven will lie to you, but you will see that he will bring considerably less men, many of them wounded from the fight.
; dlga_raethbarth_3:raethbarth_4|{s2}^^Sven Bull Neck is the man that stands in the prow of my brother Sigurd's langskip. Your accusations are serious. However, we have not heard anything about the fleet or Sven so far. These men sent from Danmark are crucial to win the battle against the Saxons in Snotingaham. Without them, we are in a difficult situation.
; dlga_raethbarth_4:raethbarth_5|For now, I cannot do anything else. I need you and your men to come to Bjorn near Snotingaham. Any reinforcement is better than none. Bjorn is my brother and has led men to support my other brothers besieged in Mierce: Halfdan, Ivarr and Hubbi. You will find him camped north of the town. All the support you can lend will be welcome. Meanwhile, I promise you that I will investigate this matter of the fleet and Sven's treason. If he is guilty, he will pay with his life.
dlga_raethbarth_5:raethbarth_6_1|Nein, Sie müssen ihn nicht töten. Sven ist mein.
dlga_raethbarth_5:raethbarth_6_2|Ich sehe. Töte ihn.
dlga_raethbarth_5:raethbarth_6_3|Da ist eine Frau bei Sven Bull Neck. Ich möchte nicht, dass ihr etwas passiert.
; dlga_raethbarth_6_1:lord_pretalk|So, I see this is personal for you. If Sven is guilty, I will give him to you so you can deal with him.
; dlga_raethbarth_6_2:lord_pretalk|That's exactly what will happen if he is guilty. I do not tolerate traitors.
; dlga_raethbarth_6_3:lord_pretalk|So be it. If Sven is guilty, I'll take care of him and keep the woman safe until you return.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_1:raethbarthbodoletter_2|This is the letter that your brother Sigurd tried so earnestly to get. I will give it to you, transcribed and decoded, so you can understand the seriousness of the danger you're facing.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_2:raethbarthbodoletter_3|{s2}^^You are a great friend of the Danish, and especially the sons of Ragnar. I must say that I knew of the existence of the alliance that unites West Seaxe, Asturias and Frankia, but I hadn't known that they had come so far. Asturias is going to send ships and men, and not any men but veterans of the wars with the Moors.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_3:raethbarthbodoletter_4|{s3}^^Frankia may have also mobilized men and ships. If West Seaxe receives these men, it will change the balance of power across the north. Sorry, I'm thinking out loud. Take this reward for serving me so well.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_4:raethbarthbodoletter_51|Thank you. Could I do anything else to help?
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_4:raethbarthbodoletter_52|I could go to Friese and learn about the Franks' movements.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_4:raethbarthbodoletter_53|I could destroy the warriors from Asturias.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_4:raethbarthbodoletter_54|I have to take care of Sven. Is there any news of him?
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_51:raethbarthbodoletter_6|{s2}^^You are helping us a lot already. I really do not know how to thank you. You know that I sent men to discover the whereabouts of Sven Bull Neck. He will pay for what he did... Now I ask you something else...
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_52:raethbarthbodoletter_6|I'm not sure we can get information in Friese. It might be best to go Frankia directly... but this is something we cannot decide right now, you and me.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_53:raethbarthbodoletter_6|{s2}^^My brother Bjorn could tell you some stories about the warriors of Asturias, and even in Al-Andalus, where he lost most of his ships. We are talking about 600 men versed in war. You should give up this matter.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_54:raethbarthbodoletter_6|I have sent men to look for Sven Bull Neck in every corner of Englaland. I can tell you that he survived his battle with Harald Haraldsson, but has not been seen since. Some say he's traveling south with his men.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_6:raethbarthbodoletter_91|I will send a messenger to my brother, Jarl Halfdan Ragnarsson, for a meeting. We will discuss this letter and make a decision soon. Meanwhile, go yourself to talk to the him and offer him your allegiance. You are a person of great ability. You must enter the service of Northhymbre for us to reward you fully as you deserve.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_91:lord_pretalk|Halfdan is a clever man who will appreciate your worth.^^After that, return to me, for I already have a task for you..
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_1_1:raethbarthbodoletter_7|Ah, {playername}. I am honored that you have joined us. Now, as I mentioned, I already have something to ask of you.^^ I need you go north, to the territory of the Kingdom of Alban. The Picts never cease to cause us problems, and we need someone to punish them.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_7:raethbarthbodoletter_81|What is it you need done?
dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_7:raethbarthbodoletter_82|Tut mir leid. Meine Priorität ist Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_81:raethbarthbodoletter_9|I want to secure our rear. We cannot take any action against the south, Asturians or Franks if the Picts can raise an army and attack Jorvik.^Recruit an army and conquer Dun Taruo. Keep it in your power for at least twenty days, so that Alban will think that we plan to attack the heart of their kingdom. If you want to keep it, it's yours, but we need twenty days to secure a deal with Alban.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_82:raethbarthbodoletter_81|I promised you Sven Bull Neck, so he will be yours, but I need time to find him. I will have more resources and time if you can help me in this matter.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_9:close_window|Good luck. When you've accomplished your mission, I'm sure I can give you an answer on Sven Bull Neck and about what I decide with my brothers.
; dlga_raethbarthbjorn_1:close_window|Glad to hear that everything went well. Come back in a few days and talk.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_1:raethbarth_wp_2|I am pleased to hear that. The Picts are warlike people, and I was not sure you made it.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_2:raethbarth_wp_3|I have good news for you, too. Sven Bull Neck was seen in East Engle. I guess he has been there because it's a kingdom that gave us supplies, horses and support when we first got to Englaland -- mostly out of fear on the part of their weak king. East Engle is a land that belongs to us by his weakness.^^The bad part is that by now Sven Bull Neck has left East Engle for West Seaxe. He is trying to run away from you. As he must know I have your back, he has sought out the strongest enemy we have.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_3:raethbarth_wp_41|Still, I do not understand why he betrayed Sigurd.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_3:raethbarth_wp_5|I must go to West Seaxe immediately.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_41:raethbarth_wp_42|{s2}^^I think I can answer that. A messenger from my brother Sigurd came to us shortly after your arrival -- unfortunately too late. Sigurd told us that we had to be careful with Sven Bull Neck. Apparently, someone killed his brother, Olvir White Hair, very dear to Sven, and the Assembly will not punish the guilty party. Sven thought that Sigurd had broken his word to him by not defending his right to revenge. So just before leaving with the fleet, Sven Bull Neck renounced his oath to Sigurd and promised to take revenge on his own.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_42:raethbarth_wp_43|I am the one who killed Olvir, but I did it in self-defense.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_42:raethbarth_wp_43.1|I am the one who killed Olvir. He was a dog that deserved what he got.
dlga_raethbarth_wp_42:raethbarth_wp_5|(Sagen Sie nichts)
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_43:raethbarth_wp_5|The messenger did not mention your name in his story, but I imagine there are many troubles between you and Sven. That can only end in blood.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_5:raethbarth_wp_6|Sven Bull Neck is now an outlaw and an enemy of the Danish -- especially the sons of Ragnar. However, West Seaxe is a strong and large kingdom. Sven Bull Neck could just hide there, and you would never find him. However, he has two things that West Seaxe needs -- ships and good sailors -- so I think I know where they will send him.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_6:raethbarth_wp_71|To meet the ships from the Kingdom of Asturias and to lead them to West Seaxe. Right?
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_6:raethbarth_wp_72|Tell me what you know.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_6:raethbarth_wp_73|Where he goes, I will go to seek him.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_71:raethbarth_wp_72|{s2}^^I like the people who serve me to be smart. You're absolutely right.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_73:raethbarth_wp_72|This obsession is your bane...
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_72:raethbarth_wp_8|During the time you were busy in the Kingdom of Alban, I met with my brothers, and we sent fast ships south for more information. Almost certainly, the Asturian fleet has left port. The letter you gave us mentioned that they are meeting with people sent from West Seaxe in Frankia, in a village called Douar-an-Enez. There is a man called Bodo, once your companion, who is now with the Saxons, so we must assume that the Saxons have the same information as we do. My feeling is that West Seaxe will send Sven Bull Neck and Bodo to Douar-an-Enez soon, if they have not already done so.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_8:raethbarth_wp_91|Bodo will not work with Sven. He hates him as much as I do.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_8:raethbarth_wp_9|Then I must go to Douar-an-Enez.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_91:raethbarth_wp_9|Maybe. I do not know so well as you this Bodo, but now he is not with you but with our enemies, and I know that you are finished with him. We cannot take the risk.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_9:raethbarth_wp_10|These men from Asturias are very important, and we could use them on our side against West Seaxe. There is a traitor among them, a man named Silo, who was a prisoner of my brother Bjorn when he was in those lands. Bjorn freed him after earning his loyalty. That man has been passing us information in exchange for silver, much silver. Use Silo to gain favor with the Asturians, to pit them against West Seaxe and join us. But if you fail to convince them, kill them all.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_10:close_window|Finish everything you have pending, as you will be out several weeks. We have gathered men and have prepared ships for them. They await you in {s3}. Ask the old captain at the port. He is the man who deals with hiring sailors. Above all, remember that it is very important that this Asturian army never helps West Seaxe.
; dlga_aethelredbodoletter_1:lord_pretalk|A letter? I am not a scribe. Talk to my brother Aelfred.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_1:aelfredbodoletter_2|This is the letter that old 'Snake in the Eye' so earnestly tried to get. My partner, Bodo, brought it here from Asturias. It proposes to send an army from Asturias, around the coast of Frankia, to West Seaxe, under the terms of the alliance. The blood of many innocents stains this letter, particularly that of the passengers of the Woden Ric, the boat where this matter started. I hope that their sacrifice will save other lives.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_2:aelfredbodoletter_2_1|{s2}^^.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_2_1:aelfredbodoletter_3|--From where you are, you can hear nothing, but you can see their lips move as Bodo gestures to put emphasis on his words. Aelfred remains calm, patiently listening and questioning. He is a young man, short and slight, but he reputedly has a hot temper that he hides very well. Finally, both return to your side.--
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_3:aelfredbodoletter_4|{playername}, West Seaxe thanks you for bringing this letter. Bodo has told me everything, and I know all the hardships you've been through because of this mission and, even more personally, the kidnapping of your mother. How may we reward you?

; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_51:aelfredbodoletter_6|{s2}^^This is not very common: selfless people willing to help for the sake of doing good. I am sure that God, our Father, who sees everything, is saving a place in paradise for you.

; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_54:aelfredbodoletter_6|Well, friendship is one of the most cherished virtues among the Saxons. By helping him, you have helped West Seaxe. Take this reward and know that as soon as we know anything of the whereabouts of Sven Bull Neck, we'll let you know.

Now, as I mentioned, I already have something to ask of you.^^We have received repeated requests from the lands of the Welsh for help. Things are very hectic there.

; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_82:aelfredbodoletter_81|You can be sure that, when you return from this mission, we will have news about Sven Bull Neck for you. Sven Bull Neck is a man known for his outbursts of rage, so our informers will soon hear something.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_81:aelfredbodoletter_9|I want you go there and take a fortress called Din Bych. Put your flag there for twenty days to demonstrate to the Welsh that we are ready to take their land by force if they are not able to keep peace among themselves.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_9:lord_pretalk|Good luck. The first time we met in Snotingaham, I never thought that you would be important to West Seaxe, but now you've done us a big favor.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_1:aethelred_wp_2|I am pleased to hear that. The Welsh are warlike people, and I was not sure you made it.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_2:aethelred_wp_3|I have good news for you, too. Sven Bull Neck was spotted in East Engle. I guess he was there because that kingdom gave the Danish supplies, horses and support when they first arrived in Englaland. It's a poor kingdom with a king whose weakness only helped the plague that has fallen upon us.^^The bad part is that Sven Bull Neck has since left East Engle and now serves Northhymbre. He is trying to run away from you. As he must know that West Seaxe has received you, he surrounds himself with our enemies.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_3:aethelred_wp_41|Still, I do not understand why they give them shelter when he killed King Horik's man.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_3:aethelred_wp_5|Then I must go to Northhymbre.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_41:aethelred_wp_42|{s2}^^The sons of Ragnar rule Northhymbre, not the king of Danmark, Horik, and from what I know, Sven Bull Neck is the prow man of Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye,' one of the most dangerous of the Ragnarssons.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_42:aethelred_wp_43|Someday Sigurd and I will settle our accounts.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_42:aethelred_wp_43.1|Sigurd may be in Danmark, but he has long arms.
dlga_aethelred_wp_42:aethelred_wp_5|(Sagen Sie nichts)
; dlga_aethelred_wp_43:aethelred_wp_5|I think you, Sven and Sigurd have many problems among you, and this can only end in blood.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_5:aethelred_wp_6|Well, Sven Bull Neck is a problem, but Northhymbre is full of Danes, and they are strong. Sven Bull Neck could just hide there, and you would never find him. However, the Ragnarssons need him to prove his worth. I think I know where they will send him.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_6:aethelred_wp_71|To meet the ships from the Kingdom of Asturias and destroy them. Right?
; dlga_aethelred_wp_6:aethelred_wp_72|Tell me what you know.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_6:aethelred_wp_73|Wherever he goes, I will go and find him.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_71:aethelred_wp_72|{s2}^^I like that the people who serve be smart. You're right.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_73:aethelred_wp_72|This obsession must be giving you headaches...
; dlga_aethelred_wp_72:aethelred_wp_8|During the time you were busy with the Welsh, I met with my brother. Almost certainly, the Asturian fleet has left port. The letter you gave us mentioned that they will meet our people in Frankia, near a village called Douar-an-Enez. I fear that, in some way, the sons of Ragnar have obtained this information.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_8:aethelred_wp_91|A man, Reginhard, betrayed me. Perhaps he mentioned this to Sigurd.
dlga_aethelred_wp_8:aethelred_wp_9_1|Ich erinnere mich, dass Sigurd einen Verräter in Asturien erwähnte. Jemand namens Silo.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_91:aethelred_wp_9|Maybe. It shows your poor judgment when it comes to choosing companions.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_9:aethelred_wp_9_1|That's not fair! I remember Sigurd mentioned a traitor in Asturias. Perhaps the information came to them from there.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_9_1:aethelred_wp_10|If there is a traitor in the fleet of the Kingdom of Asturias, you must find and kill him. These men from Asturias are very important. Do not fail us.^^Finish everything you have pending, as you will be out for several weeks. We have gathered men and have prepared ships for them. They await you in {s3}. Ask the old captain at the port. He is the man who deals with hiring sailors.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_10:lord_pretalk|Above all, remember that it is very important that this Asturian army reach West Seaxe.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_1:aelfred_ad_2|{s3}^^Yes, it's true. The news preceded you. It seems that the Danish surprised you. The army was lost, the best that we had right now, and all this work and diplomatic expense has been for nothing.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_2:aelfred_ad_31|I admit my failure.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_2:aelfred_ad_32|Thanks to my victory in Douar-an-Enez, you have 600 Danish less attacking West Seaxe.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_31:aelfred_ad_4|{s2}^^Look, it's not worth worrying about what could be and was not. Now we have problems that are more serious.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_32:aelfred_ad_4|{s2}^^I would not call it a victory. The news I received was that there was dissension in the camp of the Asturians. I distinctly remember asking you neutralize the traitor as soon as possible. If you had followed my instruction, you would have defeated the Danish and today we would have 500 veterans here to help. Well, forget it. Now we have problems that are more serious.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_4:aelfred_ad_5|We are in dire straits. The Danish became strong in Readingum, and they resisted our attempt to drive them away. My brother, King Aethelred, is convinced that God was not on our side and is trying to regain his favor by praying as much as he can. I think we need more men AND God's favor to defeat the Danish. That's why I was so desperate to see you. Ahm, did I say 'desperate?' Well, I meant I need your help, for you have proven to be a resourceful {reg59?lady:man}.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_5:aelfred_ad_6|{s2}^^The Danish are preparing to advance to our meeting. They know that if we are defeated, West Seaxe will be at their mercy, and they will do the same thing here that they did in East Engle and Northhymbre. After the defeat at Readingum, many men were scattered, and I sent out thegns to gather them and also to raise the fyrd in the villages to cover our losses. We need food to feed all these people. I need you to bring me {reg3} head of cattle so I can keep the troops fed. I care very little about where you get them. Just bring them to me as soon as you can.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_6:aelfred_ad_71|Well, I'll get the cattle while you gather your men. It's time to end the Danish.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_6:aelfred_ad_72|I'm tired of being a peon for West Seaxe.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_6:aelfred_ad_73|Sven was not in Douar-an-Enez. I cannot take search for cattle; I have to find him.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_71:lord_pretalk|Well, I knew I could count on you.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_72:aelfred_ad_74|Look, I'm usually not so expressive, but I will tell you that you are very important to West Seaxe. I understand that none of this is easy. Moreover, Sven Bull Neck is in the enemy army. Fighting on our side is the best way to reach him. Well, do something! West Seaxe needs you because we are in a situation of life or death, so we will reward you for this service. I'll pay 10,000 peningas from my own treasure. Do you agree?
; dlga_aelfred_ad_73:aelfred_ad_74|Sven Bull Neck is among our enemies, ready to pillage West Seaxe. That makes our interests coincide. Well, West Seaxe needs you in any case because we are in a life or death situation. We will reward you for this service. I'll pay 10,000 peningas from my own treasure. Do you agree?
; dlga_aelfred_ad_74:aelfred_ad_71|Your money is not necessary. I will do this to have your support to hunt to Sven Bull Neck.
dlga_aelfred_ad_74:aelfred_ad_75|Freut mich zu wissen, dass ich endlich belohnt werde. Bezahlen sie mich, und ich werde Sie Vieh bringen.
dlga_aelfred_ad_75:lord_pretalk|Nehmen Sie Ihr Geld. Nun, bringen sie das Vieh. Viel Glück.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_1:aelfred_bt_2|{s3}^^The Danish have gotten underway. They are approaching quickly. My brother is praying for victory, and we're ready. If God is on our side, we will win and save West Seaxe. Otherwise, we perish. I do not say such things very often, but thank you for everything, {playername}, especially for joining your destiny to ours.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_2:aelfred_bt_31|Do not worry, sir. Danish are the ones who should be afraid of us.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_2:aelfred_bt_32|Soon Sven and I will see each other and finish what he started on the Woden Ric.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_2:aelfred_bt_33|Thanks are not necessary. It is a pleasure to serve you.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_31:close_window|Well said. They will pay dearly for their ill-considered invasion. Now let's go to the men.
dlga_aelfred_bt_32:close_window|Sicher, wir werden Ihnen dabei helfen! Jetzt lass uns zu den Männern gehen.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_33:close_window|Do you always say what others want to hear? Leave it. Now let's go to the men.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_1:halfdan_ad_2|{s3}^^Yes, it's true. The news preceded you. It seems that the Saxons surprised you. Fortunately, you got the win and ended up with the enemy army. The Danish are in debt to you, {playername}. Let me reward you!
dlga_halfdan_ad_2:halfdan_ad_31|Es war ein harter Kampf, und es gab viele Verletzte.
dlga_halfdan_ad_2:halfdan_ad_32|Aufgrund meinen heutigen Sieg, haben die Sachsen viele Männer weniger um Westen Seaxe zu verteidigen.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_31:halfdan_ad_4|{s2}^^Now they enjoy the pleasures of Walhalla. Do not weep for the dead; they do not want to hear it.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_32:halfdan_ad_4|{s2}^^Yes, fate smiles upon us. The Norns weave the threads in our favor. We Danes hold East Engle and Northhymbre, and will soon add West Seaxe, and you, my friend, have become part of the fate of the sons of Ragnar. If my father had known you, he would have adopted you.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_4:halfdan_ad_5|Well, let's deal with the important things. Soon we leave Readingum to attack the Saxons. With every day that passes, they receive more men and become stronger. We must attack them and destroy them quickly. Then West Seaxe will be ours. They are afraid of us, very afraid, but Saxons are bold people with a strong king, not like those Angles. We will precipitate the battle and kill their king, along with that Aelfred, brother of the king, who is equally or more dangerous though he is little more than a boy.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_5:halfdan_ad_6|{s2}^^More immediately, we need meat for our warriors. I need you to bring me {reg3} head of cattle so I can keep the troops fed. I care very little about where you get them. Just bring them to me as soon as you can.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_6:halfdan_ad_71|Well, I'll get the cattle. I will kill Sven and take my share of the booty in West Seaxe.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_6:halfdan_ad_72|Do not take so many liberties. We are not friends.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_6:halfdan_ad_73|Sven was not in Douar-an-Enez. I cannot look for cattle; I have to find Sven Bull Neck.
dlga_halfdan_ad_71:close_window|Jetzt redest du! Beeile dich! Ich möchte bald loslegen.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_72:halfdan_ad_74|Oh, I see. You think like a Viking now. I can pay for the service you give. I will give you 8000 peningas now. Do you agree?
; dlga_halfdan_ad_73:halfdan_ad_74|Sven Bull Neck is with our enemies, ready to defend West Seaxe. That makes our interests coincide. Well, I will reward you for this service. I'll pay 8000 peningas. Do you agree?
; dlga_halfdan_ad_74:halfdan_ad_71|Do not worry about the money; it is not necessary. It was but a joke! I'm really with you.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_74:halfdan_ad_75|Glad to know that I will be rewarded at last. Pay me, and I'll bring cattle.
dlga_halfdan_ad_75:close_window|Nehmen Sie Ihr Geld. Nun, bringen sie das Vieh. Viel Glück.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_1:halfdan_bt_2|{s3}^^Everything is ready. It's time to get going. If West Seaxe falls, Englaland will be finished, and our people will take these fertile lands for themselves. We'll all be rich men, and our fame will rival of the heroes of the sagas, {playername}.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_2:halfdan_bt_31|West Seaxe is waiting!
; dlga_halfdan_bt_2:halfdan_bt_32|Soon Sven and I will see each other and finish what he started on the Woden Ric.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_2:halfdan_bt_33|I'm ready to shake the roots of Yggdrasill.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_31:close_window|Well said! Now let's go to the men.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_32:close_window|You should forget this obsession you have! It is your bane. Now let's go to the men.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_33:close_window|That sounds poetic! You must have the soul of a skald, seidr's son! Now let's go to the men.
; dlga_ashdown_2petition:lord_pretalk|Collect all the men that you can and come see me when you're ready.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting1_1:svenbn_hunting1|We owe you a lot, my people and I. When you finish your vendetta with Sven, you will always have a place back here with us.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting1:svenbn_hunting2|Aelfred, without your initiative, this victory would not have been possible.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting1:svenbn_hunting2.1|This victory was the work of all, Halfdan.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:svenbn_hunting21|Again, Sven Bull Neck escapes.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:svenbn_hunting22|A good fight! I'll finish with Sven and return to you with the spoils.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting2:svenbn_hunting3|Well, let us leave compliments for another time. Now I go to gather men. The enemy is not completely defeated and we have to exploit this victory.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting21:svenbn_hunting3|That's over. My men have control of Readingum. Now I go to gather men. The enemy is not completely defeated and we have to exploit this victory.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting22:svenbn_hunting3|We'll be waiting. Now, do not delay but go to meet Sven. Now I go to gather men. The enemy is not completely defeated and we have to exploit this victory.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting3:close_window|Good luck, {playername}, broedr. I never knew anyone with your luck or your destiny. Surely, you're soguligr, a worthy subject for sagas. Far thu vel!
; dlga_svenbn_hunting3:close_window.1|Good luck, {playername}. God is with you, because without His help it would be impossible that someone might do the deeds that you have done. Wes gesund!

; dlga_intrigue_quest_state_deflect_blame:lord_pretalk|I thought as much. Here's some advice for you, {reg59?lassie:lad} -- don't meddle in the quarrels of others. Now, enough of this.

; dlga_lord_ask_leave_service:lord_ask_leave_service_verify|Hrm. Has your oath become burdensome, {playername}? It is unusual to request release from homage, but in respect of your fine service, I will not hold you if you truly wish to end it. Though you would be sorely missed.
; dlga_lord_ask_leave_service:lord_ask_leave_service_verify.1|Release from homage? Hmm, perhaps it would be for the best... However, {playername}, you must be sure that release is what you desire. This is not a thing done lightly.

; dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_collect_taxes_fail|Unfortunately, a revolt broke up while I was collecting the taxes. I could only collect {reg19} peningas.
; dlga_lord_collect_taxes_success:lord_pretalk|Well done, {playername}, very well done indeed! You were truly the right {reg59?person:man} for the job. I promised you a fifth of the taxes, so that amounts to {reg21} peningas. If you give me {reg20} peningas, you may keep the difference. A good result for everyone, eh?
; dlga_lord_collect_taxes_half_success:lord_pretalk|What? Is this some scheme of yours, {playername}? That's less than half the taxes I'm owed! You have let them get away with murder as well as my money. What a farce! You can forget the money I promised you, I'm taking {reg20} peningas from what you collected, and you're lucky I'm leaving you a few coins for honour's sake.
; dlga_lord_collect_taxes_fail:lord_pretalk|God, what a bloody mess you've gotten us into, {playername}. This could turn very ugly if I do not take immediate action.

; dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to do this quest.

dlga_lord_mission_failed:lord_pretalk|{s43}
; dlga_lord_suggets_attack_enemy_castle3:lord_pretalk|That should be possible. Very well, we'll attack {s1}.
; dlga_lord_propose_mercenary:lord_mercenary_service|As it happens, {playername}, I promised {s10} that I would hire a company of mercenaries for an upcoming campaign.

; dlga_lord_mercenary_service_accept:lord_mercenary_service_verify|Perfect. Of course, you shall have to make a formal declaration of allegiance, and give your oath that you and your company will remain in service to the {s9} for a period of no less than one month.
; dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify:lord_mercenary_service_verify_2|As you wish. Your enemies are my enemies.
; dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify:lord_mercenary_service_reject|On second thought, forget it.
; dlga_lord_mercenary_service_verify_2:lord_mercenary_service_accept_3|That will do. You've made a wise choice, my friend. The {s9} does well by its loyal fighters. You will receive many rewards for your service.
; dlga_lord_mercenary_service_accept_3:lord_pretalk|Now, I suggest you prepare for a serious campaign. Train and equip your soldiers as best you can in the meantime, and respond quickly when you are summoned for duty.

; dlga_lord_mercenary_service_elaborate_duty:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Duties... There are only a few, none of them difficult. The very first thing is to declare your allegiance. An oath of loyalty to our cause. Once that's done, you shall be required to fulfill certain responsibilities.

; dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Only my loyal vassals can own lands and castles in my realm -- and all my vassals are men.\\I am not inclined to depart from this tradition without a very good reason. If you prove yourself in battle, you can swear an oath of homage to me and become my vassal.\\We may then discuss how you may obtain a castle.
; dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.1|Hmm... Only loyal vassals of {s10} can own lands and castles. While kings will sometimes accept vassalage from men who prove themselves in battle, and grant them land, I have never heard of a king who gave fiefs to women. You had best discuss that issue with {s10} himself.
; dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.2|Only my loyal vassals can own lands and castles in my realm. A mercenary cannot be trusted with such a responsibility. However, after serving for some time, you can swear homage to me and become my vassal. Then you will be rewarded with a fief.

; dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_pretalk.2|My lady, by the traditions of courtship, I should be offering my services to you. Unfortunately, I have little time right now, so I beg you to take this declaration of my esteem in its place.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_quest_mmen|I have heard that my village {s5} was raided by some masterless men a while ago. I would appreciate it very much if you could track down these scoundrels.

; dlga_lord_quest_mmen:lord_quest_mmen1|Aye, I'll do it.
; dlga_lord_quest_mmen1:close_window|Very good. The band may not have lingered long in the area, but chances are that they will be spotted by other travellers on the road.
; dlga_lord_quest_mmen:lord_mission_rejected|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:destroy_lair_quest_brief|Yes -- there is something you can do for us. We have heard reports that a group of {s4} have established a hideout in this area, and have been attacking travellers. If you could find their lair and destroy it, we would be very grateful.
; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner|My {s11}, {s13}, has been taken prisoner by {s14} of the {s15}. Normally, honorable nobles will grant prisoners of gentle blood the privilege of parole, and treat them as honored guests so long as they give their word that they will not attempt to escape, until such time as a ransom can be paid.  But {s14}, instead of granting {s13} parole, has consigned my {s11} to his dungeons -- no doubt in the hope that he can demand more from us.
; dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_confirm|We need you to get my {s11} out of prison. You may be able to pay a ransom -- in which case we could cover your expenses, up to {reg1} peningas. If you have connections within {s24}, you may be able to use them to sneak him out. Or, you may try a more direct approach -- walk up to the gaoler, take the keys by force, and then fight your way out. Can you do this for us?

; dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak_2|I had discussed this idea with some of my men. One could enter {s24}, either in disguise or openly, then walk up to the prison guard and try to take the keys by force. However, getting out may be difficult. The garrison may be slow to react, but even so, you are likely to find yourself fighting a half dozen or more of the enemy at once, with limited space in which to maneuver. If you can fight your way past them, though, you can probably get out.
; dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak_2:lord_mission_rescue_other_ideas|You may find it useful to create a distraction, to divert the attention of some of the garrison. If you have any connections in the villages near {s24}, this may be a time to put them to use.
; dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_siege:lord_mission_rescue_other_ideas|Well, that is certainly the most direct approach.

; dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|Hmm, yes. I have heard from the port master in Ribe that the monastery at {s14} has a considerable amount of silver stored. I was going to pay those monks a visit myself, but I'm currently occupied with some other things. So here is what I propose: if you go there and bring me {reg33} peningas, you can keep the rest.

; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_pretalk|I don't have anything else for you to do right now.
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told|Oh, {playername}, there is a delicate matter. I need you to take a message to my... to {s3}. Do you think you could do me this little favor? {s33}
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told.1|{s13}
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told.2|{s13}
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told.3|Oh, I fear I may never see my {s17}, {s13}, again... He is a prisoner in the dungeon of {s14}. We have tried to negotiate his ransom, but it has been set too high. We can never hope to raise that much money without selling everything we own, and God knows {s13} would rather spend his life in prison than make us destitute. Instead, I came up with a plan to get him out of there, but it requires someone to make a great sacrifice, and so far, my pleas have fallen on deaf ears...
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told.4|My poor {s11}, {s13}, is a prisoner in the {s14} dungeons. The only way we can talk to each other is by exchanging letters whenever we can, but the journey is so dangerous that we get little chance to do so. Please, would you deliver one for me?
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_quest_duel_for_lady|Dear {playername}, you are kind to ask, but you know little of my troubles and I can't possibly ask you to throw yourself into danger on my behalf.
; dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2|Tell me what the problem is, and I can make my own decision.
; dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3|Very well, as you wish it... My husband has made certain enemies in his life, {playername}. One of the most insidious is {s13}. He is going around making terrible accusations against me, impugning my honour at every turn! Because he cannot harm my husband directly, he is using me as a target to try and stain our name. You should hear the awful things he's said! I only wish there was someone brave enough to make him recant his slander, but {s13} is a very fine swordsman, and he's widely feared...
; dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted|I fear him not, {s65}. I will make him take back his lies.
; dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted:close_window|Oh! I can't ask that of you, {playername}, but... I would be forever indebted to you, and you are so sure. It would mean so much if you would defend my honour. Thank you a thousand times, all my prayers and my favour go with you.
; dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected|If he is that dangerous, perhaps maybe it would be better to ignore him...
; dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected:close_window|Oh... Perhaps you're right, {playername}. I should let go of these silly childhood ideas of chivalry and courage. {reg59?People:Men} are not like that, not anymore. Good day to you.
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_ask_for_quest_past|Well, {playername}, there is a delicate matter that I am not sure how to solve. I have been having nightmares lately...
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past:lady_ask_for_quest_past2|You can count on me, my lady. Your secret is safe with me.
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past:lady_mission_rejected|Nightmares? Hmm. Well, good luck with that.
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past2:lady_ask_for_quest_past3|Well, {playername}, when I was younger, many years ago, there was a very handsome young guard in our castle. I had never seen anyone so handsome. Long story short, we fell in love, and..., well, we became lovers. But then I was married off to my husband, and my love was sent away. I have never seen him again. I have always suspected that either my father or my husband or both of them learned about our affair and sent him to die somewhere, or just hired an assassin to kill him. It was many years ago, but suddenly I started having these dreams in which he is calling me, asking me to go with him and saying that my husband is the one who murdered him. But many years have passed, and I don't feel the infatuation anymore. He's dead, and I'm not, so how can I join him, anyway? Is he a ghost now, asking me to die to join him?
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past3:lady_ask_for_quest_past4|No need to worry, my lady. I will deal with this 'ghost.' Where exactly is he calling you?
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past3:lady_mission_rejected|Entschuldigung, Ich kann dir dabei nicht helfen.
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past4:close_window|He seems to be somewhere around {s33}. Oh, {playername}, I am so grateful. But, please, I beg you, be very discrete about this matter. I don't want my husband or anyone else to know about what happened.
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_pretalk.1|No, {playername}, I've no need for a champion right now.
; dlga_lady_mission_told:lady_mission_accepted|As you wish, {s65}, it shall be done.
; dlga_lady_mission_told:lady_mission_rejected|{s66}, I fear I cannot help you right now.
; dlga_lady_mission_accepted:close_window|You are a true {reg59?lady:gentleman}, {playername}. Thank you so much for helping me
; dlga_lady_mission_rejected:close_window|You'll not help a woman in need? You should be ashamed, {playername}... Please leave me. I have some important embroidery to catch up on.
; dlga_lady_talk:lady_restore_relation|I want to improve my relation with a lord. Can you help me?
; dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_pretalk|{playername}, I don't know you well enough to act on your behalf. I am sorry.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_restore_relation_2|Hmm. I guess you got on the wrong side of somebody. Very well, with whom do you want to restore your relation?
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_restore_relation_2b|{s1}
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_pretalk|Never mind. I get along with everyone well enough.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_2b:lady_restore_relation_3|Well I can try to help you there. I am sure a few expensive gifts will make {s10} look at you more favorably.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_3:lady_restore_relation_4|You can improve your relation with {s10} by sending {reg4?her:him} a gift worth {reg10} peningas. But if you can afford spending {reg11} peningas on the gift, it would make a good impression on {reg4?her:him}. And if you can go up to {reg12} peningas, that would really help smooth things out.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5|I think a gift of {reg10} peningas will do.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.1|Maybe I can afford {reg11} peningas.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.2|In that case, I am ready to spend {reg12} peningas.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_cant_afford|I don't think I can afford a gift at the moment.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_5:lady_restore_relation_6|Excellent. Then I'll choose an appropriate gift for you and send it to {s10} with your compliments. I am sure {reg4?she:he} will appreciate the gesture.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_6:lady_pretalk|Thank you for your help, madame.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_cant_afford:lady_pretalk|I am afraid that I cannot be of much help in that case, {playername}. I am sorry.

; dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options|You have a point, {playername}. I admit that much. However, I am not yet convinced I should do as you bid.
; dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.1|Enough, {playername}. You've made a lot of arguments, but I find none of them truly convincing. I stand by what I said before.
; dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.2|Truthfully, {playername}, I fail to see the virtue of your reasoning. What you ask for makes even less sense now than it did before.

; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2|According to our laws and traditions, you can do one of several things. First, you could station a garrison here to protect the castle from any immediate counterattacks, then request an audience with some wealthy lord and ask him to make you an offer. It would be worth a tidy sum, believe you me. If you do not wish to sell, then you will have to find yourself a liege lord and protector who would accept homage from you. Without a royal investiture and an army at your back, you would have a difficult time holding on to the castle. Both you and {s1} would become great big targets for any man with a few soldiers and a scrap of ambition. 
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3|What do you mean, a liege lord and protector? I won this place by my own hand. I don't need anyone else!
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4|Of course you don't, my {reg59?lady:lord}. However, no lord in the land will recognize your claim to the castle unless it is verified by royal decree. They would call {s1} an outlaw stronghold and take it from you at the earliest opportunity. Surely, not even you could stand against a whole army.
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4:siege_won_seneschal_6|Hmm. I'll give it some thought.
; dlga_siege_won_seneschal_6:close_window|I am very pleased to hear it, my {reg59?lady:lord}. I am only trying to serve you to the best of my ability. Now, if at any time you find you have further need of me, I will be in the great hall arranging a smooth handover of the castle to your forces.

; dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.1|Your relations with {s4} are not all that they could be. As {reg4?she:he} is my {s11}, I can mediate to attempt to mend your quarrel. Perhaps the best way for me to do this would be to send {reg4?her:him} a gift, perhaps, if I may suggest, some bracelets and brooches, and a length of silver fox fur. If you can provide me with these items, I can have them sent to {reg4?her:him} on your behalf.
; dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.1|Splendid. I shall await the materials.
; dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.2|As you may realize, {s4} has many enemies among the lords of the {s5}. In particular, they feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to denounce {s4} to {reg4?her:his} face, you may reap much popularity -- although, of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him} and risk being challenged to a duel.
; dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.3|As you may realize, many of us in the peerage of the {s5} consider {s4} to be {s7}, and a liability to our cause. We worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. People know my views on {s4} already, but if you were to denounce {reg4?her:him} to {reg4?her:his} face, you would further erode his standing -- and discourage our liege from entrusting {reg4?her:him} with any more power or responsibility. Of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him} and risk being challenged to a duel.{s9}

; dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.4|You and I have a common interest in seeking to curtail the rise of {s4}. I feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to tell our liege {s9} your opinion of {s4}, it might discourage {s9} from granting {s4} any further powers or responsibilities, at least for a while, and I would be much obliged to you.

; dlga_start:ransom_broker_intro|Greetings to you, {reg59?madam:sir}. You look like someone who should get to know me.
dlga_ransom_broker_intro:ransom_broker_intro_2|Warum das?
; dlga_ransom_broker_intro_2:ransom_broker_info_talk|I broker ransoms for the poor wretches who are captured in these endless wars. Normally I travel between the salt mines and the slave markets on the coast, on commission from those whose relatives have gone missing. But if I'm out on my errands of mercy, and I come across a fellow dragging around a captive or two, well, there's no harm in a little speculative investment, is there? And you look like the type who might have a prisoner to sell.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_families|Was ist, wenn ihre Familien nicht bezahlen kann?
; dlga_ransom_broker_families:ransom_broker_info_talk|Oh, then I spin them a few heartwarming tales of life on the galleys. You'd be surprised what sorts of treasures a peasant can dig out of his cowshed or wheedle out of his cousins, assuming he's got the proper motivation! If, in the end, they cannot come up with the silver, then there are always slave merchants who are looking for galley slaves. One cannot do Heaven's work with an empty purse, you see.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_prices|Was kann ich für einen Gefangenen bekommen?
; dlga_ransom_broker_prices:ransom_broker_info_talk|It varies. I fancy that I have a fine eye for assessing a ransom. There are a dozen little things about a man that will tell you whether he goes to bed hungry, or dines each night on soft dumplings and goose. The real money of course is in the gentry, and if you ever want to do my job you'll want to learn about every landowning family in the Northlands, their estates, their heraldry, their offspring both lawful and bastard, and, of course, their credit with the merchants.
; dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_me|Would you be able to ransom me if I were taken?
; dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_me:ransom_broker_info_talk|Of course. I'm welcome in every court in the Northlands. There are not many who can say that! So always be sure to keep a pot of peningas buried somewhere, and a loyal servant who can find it in a hurry.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_pretalk|Das ist alles, was ich wissen muss. Vielen Dank.

; dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk.1|Thanks, but I don't really care.
; dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk.1|Greetings, {playername}.
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretalk:tavern_traveler_talk|Ja?
; dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms|What can you tell me about this land?
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2|The Northlands is divided into many kingdoms that can neither manage to live in peace with their neighbours nor eliminate them. As a result, there's seldom a break in the bitter wars that plague this land and drain its lifeblood. Well, at least this ought to be a good place to be for an adventurer such as you. With some luck and skill, you can make a name for yourself here, amass a fortune perhaps, or gain great power. Opportunities are endless, and so are the rewards, if you are willing to risk your life for them.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3|Tell me more about these opportunities.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:close_window|Thank you. That was all I needed to know
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Well, you probably know everything I could tell you already. You seem to be doing pretty well.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a|The kingdoms will pay good money for mercenaries if they are engaged in a war. If you have done a bit of fighting, speaking with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a mercenary contract.^^Better rewards come if you can manage to become a vassal to a king. A vassal can own villages, castles and towns and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these estates. Normally, only nobles of the realm own land in this way, but in time of war, a king will not hesitate to accept someone who distinguishes {reg59?herself:himself} on the battlefield as a vassal, and grant {reg59?her:him} the right to own land.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|It is not unheard-of for adventurers to renounce allegiance to a king altogether, declare themselves kings, and claim land in their own name. This is a difficult path, however, as the great nobles of the land, with their long ancestries, are not likely to accept such upstarts as their monarch. Such rulers would need to be very careful in establishing their right to rule, or they would be set upon from all sides.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5|It might be easier for an adventurer like you to pledge support to an existing king's rival. There are many such pretenders in the Northlands -- those who are born to the right family, who go around and stir up trouble saying they have a better claim to the throne than the current king does. If those claim holders could find supporters, they could easily start civil wars and perhaps even replace the king one day.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6|Interesting. Where can I find these claim holders?
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:close_window|I guess I heard enough already. Thank you.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6:tavern_traveler_pretalk|A claim holder's life would be in danger in his own country of course. Therefore, they usually stay at rival courts, raising support and hoping to find someone willing to champion their cause. I usually hear news about some of them, and may be able to tell you their location with some precision. But of course, I would ask for a little something for such a service.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_pretender_location|I want to know the location of a claimant.

; dlga_start:minstrel_1|Greetings to you, {reg59?most noble lady:most noble sir}.
; dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_job_description|What is it that you do?
; dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_questions|I have some questions about courtship in these lands.
; dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_poem|Can you teach me any poems?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach|I can teach you the tale of Aeneas and Dido, from the Aeneid. It is an allegoric poem that describes how Dido, the Queen of Carthage, fell in love, under the influence of the gods, with the Trojan hero Aeneas. When reminded by Jupiter, he leaves his lover to fulfill his duty to found a new city, Dido commits suicide, cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome. Its theme -- of strong love separated by fate and cursed by suicide -- is appreciated by some noble ladies, but not all.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.1|I can teach you The Voyage of Bran. This Goidelic saga can be interpreted either erotically or prophetically. Bran, son o Fedbal, and his expedition of twenty-one companions journey to a distant island of luxury and pleasure. Upon return, he learns that ages have passed, and he and his expedition have already passed into myth. He can never again touch the soil of his homeland and sails off again. I believe that it appeals to women of a certain romantic temperament, but you risk scandalizing or boring others.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.2|I can teach you the tragic tale of Orpheus, son of Morpheus and the muse Calliope. It is a sad and powerful story. He travels to the Underworld to bring back Euridyce, his deceased wife, but is unable to obey the condition imposed by Hades and Persephone. Hear me.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.3|I can teach you the saga of Beowulf. It is a heroic tale, full of blood and battle. Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, battles three powerful antagonists: Grendel, a horrid monster, who has been attacking the resident warriors of the mead hall of Hrodgar, king of the Danish, Grendel's mother, and a terrible dragon. Hear me.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.4|I can teach you the Aesopica, the famous fables of Aesop. The tales of this slave and storyteller usually feature animals, and are both comical, satirizing man and animal, and moral, for its practical lessons on life. Pay you heed.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2|To teach it to you, I will need some hours of your time -- and, of course, a small fee for my services. About 300 peningas would suffice.

; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|What do you wish to know?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_prequestions:minstrel_courtship_questions_2|Can I answer any other questions for you?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_role|Is there a place for me in the game of love?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_meet|How would a suitor meet a lady?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo|Having met a lady, how would the suitor woo her?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_nobles|Tell me about marriage and love among the nobility of the Northlands
; dlga_minstrel_nobles:minstrel_nobles_2|Nobles are an odd lot. In the Northlands, a daughter is a political asset, to be given away to a lord with whom her father wishes to make an alliance. Yet the great families of this land idealize pure love between man and woman, and I have seen many a hardened warrior weep copious tears at the doomed ardour of Gwenhwyfar and Llwch Llenlleawg in the bards' songs -- even as he made plans to break his own daughter's heart.
; dlga_minstrel_nobles_2:minstrel_nobles_3|Fathers differ, of course. Some nobles will let their daughters choose a husband who pleases them. Others, however, feel that to allow their daughters any choice at all would be to diminish their own authority, and insist on imposing a groom whether she likes it or not.
; dlga_minstrel_nobles_3:minstrel_prequestions|But the majority will steer a middle course -- they will want to make the final decision about a groom, but will weigh their daughter's preferences heavily. Among other factors, a happy marriage is more likely to produce heirs, so there is still a place for courtship and for the use of skill and passion to win a lady's heart.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_daughter_father|What if a lady and her father disagree about a suitor?
; dlga_minstrel_daughter_father:minstrel_daughter_father_2|It happens sometimes that a bride elopes. This is a major blow to the father's prestige, leading to lasting enmities. Indeed, a war may be fought over a woman. Now, that is a fine topic for a song.
; dlga_minstrel_daughter_father_2:minstrel_prequestions|In the end, however, most brides will submit to their parents' choice. A noblewoman's family is everything to her, and few are brave enough to risk its disapproval for the sake of man she barely knows. She may pine for her lover, but still accept the groom -- and without tragic love, what would we have to sing about?
; dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_player_role_2|Of course! Lords make a great deal of lineage, but in the end, lands and money speak louder than one's ancestors. Even though you are a foreigner, if you are coming up in the world, then many parents will consider you a fine catch.
; dlga_minstrel_player_role_2:minstrel_player_role_3|You will have to compete with many other lords of your realm, however, who will have an advantage. They have known these ladies from childhood and have been sized up as grooms by carefully discerning mothers and aunts. Some ladies may be fascinated by the stranger, yet opt for the familiar.
; dlga_minstrel_player_role_3:minstrel_prequestions|So know this -- you may have your heart broken. But to enter the arena of love fearing heartbreak is like entering the battlefield fearing the enemy's arrows. Be brave, and shrug off the sting of rejection, and victory may yet be yours.
; dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_female_player_3|Lady -- I will speak bluntly. Most of the lords of this land are looking for a demure maiden, whose skin as fair as snow -- and your skin is burnt brown by the sun. They want a maiden whose voice is soft as bells -- and your voice is hoarse from commanding men in battle. Also, although the lords of the Northlands appreciate poems about love, most also want heirs, and few women can ride and fight while with child.
; dlga_minstrel_female_player_3:minstrel_prequestions|However, not all lords will be so conventionally minded. We poets sing of shield maidens and of huntresses, of women who forged their own path without having sacrificed the chance for love. I would not tell you that it would be easy for you to find a devoted husband who will accept your ways, but I would not say that it is impossible.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_spouse_benefits|What advantage is there in seeking a {reg59?husband:wife}?
; dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may forge a strong alliance with the bride's family, and a wife may also assist you in manipulating the politics of the realm to your advantage.
; dlga_minstrel_wife_benefits_2:minstrel_prequestions|What's more, most of the great families of the Northlands have at some point intermarried with royalty, which would boost your own claim to rule -- should you ever choose to assert it...
; dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2.1|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may have access to the groom's castles and properties, and be able to work with him to advance both of your standings in the realm.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet:minstrel_player_advice_meet_2|Every so often, a king or great lord of the Northlands will hold a feast. In towns, they will often be accompanied by tournaments. In castles, they will be accompanied by hunts. The feasts provide a chance for the lords to repair some of the rivalries that may undermine the strength of the realm. They also provide an opportunity for families to show off their eligible daughters, and ladies will often be allowed to mingle unsupervised with the guests.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet_2:minstrel_prequestions|If you have the opportunity, you may attempt to pay the lady a compliment. This indicates to her that you are a potential suitor, and she will usually know if she wishes you to continue your suit. Incidentally, if you come to her fresh from having distinguished yourself in the tournament or in the hunt, then you may make a stronger first impression than otherwise.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo:minstrel_player_advice_woo_2|To woo a lady takes a certain amount of time and patience, and several meetings spaced over a period of months. A lady who is interested in you will often find ways of letting you know if she wishes you to come visit her. Alternately, you may simply go and ask her father or brother for permission. If you do not have permission from her guardian, it may be possible to arrange an assignation through other means.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo_3|Having arranged an assignment, you may then attempt to charm her and win her favor. Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of this is finding a topic of conversation. Most noblewomen lead a cloistered life, at least until they are married, and thus will have little to say that will interest you. On other hand, she will soon tire of hearing of your own deeds in the outside world.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_3:minstrel_player_advice_woo_4|One time-tested mode of courtship is simply to recite a popular poem, and discuss it. This way, you are both on an equal footing, and neither will have an advantage in knowledge or experience. Of course, different ladies will have different tastes in poetry.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_4:minstrel_player_advice_woo_5|At some point, you will be able to discuss directly the issue of marriage. She will then let you know if you measure up to what she wants in a husband. Some ladies will coolly assess who is the most prestigious of her suitors, while others will be guided by their passions. Some will look to your companions, to see whether you are the kind of husband who will treat her as an equal, while others will follow the lead of their fathers.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_5:minstrel_prequestions|At any rate, it is a challenging business -- and do not forget, you may find that your suit prospers with a lady, only to have it falter on a father's political ambitions. So you must ask yourself: are you willing to risk disappointment and heartbreak? Alternately, are you willing to throw away your standing in society, to make enemies of allies, in pursuit of a forbidden love? Because if you are, then perhaps someday we will write poems about you.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_job_description|What is it that you poets and musicians do again?
; dlga_minstrel_job_description:minstrel_courtship_prequestions|I compose and write songs for the lords of the land, and their ladies. Sometimes I sing about war, sometimes about the virtues of kings, and sometimes, for the more sophisticated audiences, about the virtues of wine. For most audiences, however, I sing of love.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_pretalk|No, that is all.

; dlga_trainer_talk_combat1:trainer_pretalk2|I guess I know all theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat:trainer_explain_combat_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat_2:trainer_explain_combat_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat_3:trainer_explain_combat_4|What if I don't have a shield?
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat_4:trainer_explain_combat_5|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore, you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way, you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat_5:trainer_explain_combat_6|Finally, Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat_6:trainer_explain_combat_7|That sounds useful.
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat_7:trainer_explain_combat_8|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat_8:trainer_explain_combat_9|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat_9:trainer_pretalk2|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [To control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_practice_11:trainer_practice_11|If I may say so, I see great warrior in you. ^^Some sailors have been idle since we stopped. Let's see if one of them could help us.

; dlga_novicemaster_not_ready1:close_window|Hey, you will never make it if you don't practice.
; dlga_start:close_window.90|Please, kind {reg59?madame:sir}, help us! I don't want to be a slave!
; dlga_start:bodo_prisoner_sl|Hi {playername}. Glad to see you are alive. I thought you were killed when Sven Bull Neck's men attacked us. I was not so lucky, as you can see.
; dlga_bodo_prisoner_sl:bodo_prisoner_s2|Bodo! What? Where is my mother? And who are these women?
; dlga_bodo_prisoner_sl:close_window|Let me get you out of here, my friend, and then we'll talk.
; dlga_bodo_prisoner_s2:close_window|We can't talk here; there are too many ears listening. Get me out of here, and I will tell you everything.
; dlga_start:close_window.91|Please, kind {reg59?madame:sir}, help us. I don't want to be a slave.
; dlga_start:bodo_merchant_1|Good day, {playername}. It is good to see that you are well. You were giving us a fright, talking in your sleep. I'd hate to be the one troubled by such dreams...
; dlga_bodo_merchant_1:bodo_merchant_2|I'm fine, thank you. No one has need to worry.
dlga_bodo_merchant_1:bodo_merchant_22|{s10}
; dlga_bodo_merchant_1:bodo_merchant_21|Well, I can't see how my affairs are anyone else's business!
; dlga_bodo_merchant_2:bodo_merchant_3|Perhaps not. At any rate, it's good to see you up and about, friend.
dlga_bodo_merchant_22:bodo_merchant_3|{s2}
; dlga_bodo_merchant_21:bodo_merchant_3|No need to get angry! I was just speaking as a friend. It's just good to see you up and about.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_3:bodo_merchant_4a|Remind me who you are. To tell the truth, my mind is still a little foggy.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_3:close_window|Thanks! Now I'm going to help check out those ships. Farewell for now.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_4a:bodo_merchant_5|Why, I am Bodo. I hail from Cantabria, in the Kingdom of Asturias, in the north of the land that the Romans called Hispania. We've become well acquainted on this voyage.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_5:bodo_merchant_6|Then I know you've told me your story, but I'd like to hear it again.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_5:close_window|Oh, that's right... Bodo. Well, I go now to help check out those ships. Farewell for now.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_6:bodo_merchant_7|Perhaps some other time. I think right now I want to keep an eye on the horizon. I'm not as convinced as the captain that stopping here is a good idea.
; dlga_start:close_window.92|I thought I saw something a minute ago, but the mist over these waters plays tricks on the eyes... Probably nothing. I hope it's nothing. This ship's fast enough, but can't outrun a warship.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_7:bodo_merchant_8|I'm worried as well. I'm glad you are watching, my friend.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_7:close_window|What could be the harm of it? But to speed things along, I will help check out those ships.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_8:close_window|And I'm glad to do it for you. We've become such good friends on this trip, I'm sorry we will soon part. If we meet again in the future and you need my help, you have it, my friend.
; dlga_start:esposabarco_1|{s2}^^My {reg59?daughter:son}, it is such a nice day! The sea is so bright! It is truly a pity to have all these shipwrecks spoil the scene!
; dlga_esposabarco_1:esposabarco_12|Yes, Mother. I'm glad you are well today.
; dlga_esposabarco_1:esposabarco_11|You remember me? That's wonderful!
; dlga_esposabarco_1:close_window|I will see you later, Mother.
; dlga_esposabarco_12:esposabarco_13|{s2}^^Not only well but happy! I'm glad we made this trip, but we must remember to be home to make dinner! Your father will expect it.
; dlga_esposabarco_11:esposabarco_13|{s2}^^You are my baby. I am your mother. Why would I or Father forget you?
dlga_esposabarco_13:esposabarco_14|Aber... Vater ist tot.
; dlga_esposabarco_13:close_window|Mother, we are going home right now. I love you.
; dlga_esposabarco_14:esposabarco_15|{s2}^^But... But... We aren't on a trip near home, are we? My head hurts so much, I don't remember where home is! I know who you are, but I don't remember your name. Am I crazy?
; dlga_esposabarco_15:esposabarco_16|No, you've only forgotten a few things.
; dlga_esposabarco_15:esposabarco_17|No, you're just sick. But soon we will see someone that will make you better.
; dlga_esposabarco_15:close_window|Yes, but we're getting help for you. Farewell, then, for the moment.
; dlga_esposabarco_16:close_window|{s2}^^Oh dear. I think I need a moment alone. Please go.
; dlga_esposabarco_17:esposabarco_18|{s2}^^I am not so sure that anybody can heal this, my {reg59?daughter:son}.
; dlga_esposabarco_18:close_window|We are almost there! Please don't give up now. We'll talk more later.
; dlga_start:close_window.93|I'd like to chat, but I must complete my chores now.
; dlga_start:sailors_merchant_1|Ic grete thee, {playername}. I'd like to chat, but I must complete my chores now. We will talk later.
; dlga_sailors_merchant_1:close_window|Very well. We will talk tonight at the anchorage.
; dlga_start:close_window.94|[Enemy lookouts watch you closely from the walls of Readingum.]
; dlga_start:arquerosb_merchant_1|Talk to the boss, {playername}, that veteran in the prow of the boat over there. He's the one that can best train you in fighting.
; dlga_arquerosb_merchant_1:close_window|Thanks, I will do that.
; dlga_start:frisianship_merchant_1|West thu hal, {playername}. Are you well today? You were moving violently in your sleep and saying incomprehensible things. My sailors thought you were being tormented by a spirit.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_1:frisianship_merchant_2|Where am I? What is this place?
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_2:frisianship_merchant_3|Oh, this is bad. You don't remember anything? My name is Avo, leof. I am the captain of this ship, the Woden Ric. You embarked with us in Friese some weeks ago, paying well for us to take you on.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_3:frisianship_merchant_4a|Yes, yes, I remember now.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_3:frisianship_merchant_4b|Oh, it's coming back to me now, but perhaps you can remind me why am I here?
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_4a:frisianship_merchant_5|Well, don't worry. These things happen to everyone.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_4b:frisianship_merchant_5|Now I'm really starting to worry about you. I don't know the details, but do know that you worry for your mother. She is sick, and you were taking her to a priest of great healing ability in the Frisian port where we are going.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_5:frisianship_merchant_6|Thanks! But it's light out. Shouldn't we be under full sail? The boat is not moving! What is happening? Why have we stopped?
; dlga_start:close_window.95|May we talk later, {reg59?madame:sir}? I need to give some orders to my men.
; dlga_start:frisianship_merchant_talk|Good day. We are ready to cast off. Are you ready?
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_talk:frisianship_merchant_1x|I am ready. Please, let us continue our voyage.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_talk:close_window|No, I need to do something before we leave.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_1x:frisianship_merchant_2x|{s2}^^We've been together on this voyage some time. Would you like to try the rudder? She steers very nimbly for a merchantman.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_2x:close_window|Why, I've been wondering when you'd ask!
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_2x:close_window.1|No. Believe me, I think you'd want me to touch it only a last resort!
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_6:frisianship_merchant_7|We found a bit of wreckage, some half-sunken ships. Looks like there was a fight here recently. I have my men checking out the situation and looking for survivors. Poor bastards wouldn't have had a chance against Viking long ships. We'll be on our way soon enough, though.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_7:frisianship_merchant_8|Oh. Could we hurry it along? Whoever sunk those ships might still be nearby.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_7:close_window|Well, finally a bit of excitement! I think I'll go and help them.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_8:frisianship_merchant_9|{s2}^^Relax, {reg59?woman:man}. Your friend, Bodo, insisted on keeping watch. I doubt that fellow ever misses a thing!
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_9:frisianship_merchant_10|Bodo? Yes. Well, I'm still worried.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_9:frisianship_merchant_11|I sure hope you know what you're doing.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_10:close_window|{s2}^^If you had been on one of those ships instead of this one, you'd want us to stop, now wouldn't you? It's the law of the sea -- especially this sea.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_11:close_window|Be assured, I do, {reg59?madame:sir}. Now let me tend to this matter, or we'll be delayed even longer.
; dlga_start:frisianship_mer_1|Oh, Woden, we're in trouble!
; dlga_start:close_window.96|May we talk later, {reg59?madame:sir}? I need to give some orders to my men.
; dlga_frisianship_mer_1:frisianship_mer_2|What's happened?
; dlga_frisianship_mer_2:frisianship_mer_3|Shh! Keep quiet. Listen, we're in danger. As we were watching your fight, two long ships arrived. Now I can see the banner. It's Sven Bull-Neck. Ah, dammit! You'd better pray to whatever gods you worship. Hell, you may as well pray to those you don't! Won't matter at all if he catches us.
; dlga_frisianship_mer_3:frisianship_mer_4c|I knew this would happen! We should not have stopped.
; dlga_frisianship_mer_3:frisianship_mer_4b|Calm down, man! Tell me: who's Sven?
; dlga_frisianship_mer_3:frisianship_mer_4c.1|This is terrible news! What shall we do?
; dlga_frisianship_mer_4b:frisianship_mer_4c|You've not heard of him? Sven's a Viking. Worse, a Viking's Viking. He burns villages and sinks ships and enslaves or kills everyone in them. Everyone! But it's worst for the one he chooses for a hideous death as a sacrifice to his gods. Heard of Blodorn, the Blood Eagle? You don't want to know what that means. Now keep quiet.
; dlga_frisianship_mer_4c:frisianship_mer_5|{s2}^^I think they're passing by. If we stay still right here, they may just think we're another bit of the wreckage. That's our only hope.
; dlga_frisianship_mer_5:frisianship_mer_6|What? We should have already been escaping into the mist. Row, men, for all it's worth!
; dlga_frisianship_mer_5:frisianship_mer_6.1|Please, calm down, my friend. We mustn't make a wrong move here!
; dlga_frisianship_mer_6:close_window|{s1}^^Sven's spotted us! They're turning this way! Nothing for it but to move. Cut the anchor and start rowing! Oh, Woden, it's no use. Help!
; dlga_start:petro_leader_1|Greetings! My name is Petro Didaz of Oveto, and I am a duke in the service of King Aldefonso of Asturias. These men are Silo, who comes from Farum in Gallaecia, and Gundinsalvo, who comes from Amaia, in Cantabria. We are surprised that you have submitted to us with so many ships and men. We want to know who you are.
; dlga_petro_leader_1:petro_leader_3|My name is {playername}. I come on behalf of the sons of Ragnar to negotiate with you.
; dlga_petro_leader_1:petro_leaderwessex_4|My name is {playername}. Aethelred, the king of West Seaxe, sends me to serve as your escort to his kingdom.
; dlga_petro_leader_3:petro_leader_31|I do not think that's...
; dlga_petro_leader_31:petro_leader_32|Ragnar's sons are powerful and well-known men. You should hear their proposal.
; dlga_petro_leader_32:petro_leader_33|{s2}^^Yes, listen to their messenger. After he sings his song, we can kill him.
; dlga_petro_leader_33:petro_leader_34|Rathbarth Ragnarsson wants you to join him and his brothers against West Seaxe.
; dlga_petro_leader_33:petro_leader_34.1|Rathbarth Ragnarsson promises you half of West Seaxe if you join him.
; dlga_petro_leader_33:petro_leader_34.2|Rathbarth Ragnarsson will fill your boat with riches if you join him.
; dlga_petro_leader_34:petro_leader_35|And if they do not join, what will he do? Kill them? Did he send you here with a fleet to make friends?
; dlga_petro_leader_35:petro_leader_36|Bodo?
; dlga_petro_leader_35:petro_leader_36_1|Exactly. It is your choice.
; dlga_petro_leader_35:petro_leader_36_2|If I wanted you dead, I would have attacked. I am offering an alliance with fellow winners.
; dlga_petro_leader_36_1:petro_leader_36|{s2}^^I like things simple and clear. I like this guy.
; dlga_petro_leader_36_2:petro_leader_36|Now you're talking.
; dlga_petro_leader_36:petro_leader_37|This {reg59?woman:man} is a liar. I traveled with {reg59?her:him} for a long time. I offered {reg59?her:him} my friendship. I fought beside {reg59?her:him} and served {reg59?her:him} faithfully. But when the time came, {reg59?she:he} betrayed me and delivered the letter to the Vikings. That's why {reg59?she:he} is here today with that fleet: to destroy you and the alliance between West Seaxe, Frankia and Asturias.
; dlga_petro_leader_37:petro_leader_37_1|The Danish rule the North. It will take an alliance to keep Asturias safe.
; dlga_petro_leader_37:petro_leader_38_1|West Seaxe is weak and ripe for conquest. Don't you want to enjoy the glory and loot?
; dlga_petro_leader_37:petro_leader_41|I didn't come this far to listen to this nonsense. What is your decision?
; dlga_petro_leader_37_1:petro_leader_37_2|That has been my position for some time now. Better Danmark than West Seaxe. The Danish control practically all the north while West Seaxe barely controls its own kingdom. An alliance with the Danish would mean that the Vikings would stay away from Asturias. Maybe we could even use them against Al-Andalus.
; dlga_petro_leader_37_2:petro_leader_37_3|What? Then all the fun would end. I like killing Vikings and keeping their boats.
; dlga_petro_leader_37_3:petro_leader_40|Someone who truly knows the north would not say that. The king of the Danish does not have the power to control the Vikings. The Vikings are free men who have embraced the sea to get wealth and fame, and if their king tried to stop them, they would find another king.
; dlga_petro_leader_38_1:petro_leader_38_2|West Seaxe can still fight, and I think it would be quite good at it. You sing well, messenger. It would be nice to switch our looting to places other than the lands of the Moors.
; dlga_petro_leader_38_2:petro_leader_38_3|Well, this sounds good to me.
; dlga_petro_leader_38_3:petro_leader_38_4|You're forgetting that our king has an alliance with the king of West Seaxe. Is it your intention to disobey your king?
; dlga_petro_leader_38_4:petro_leader_40|Do not be deceived by {reg59?her:his} flattering words. Anyone who pays attention to {reg59?her:him} ends badly.
; dlga_petro_leader_41:petro_leader_40|Are you listening to {reg59?her:him}? Makes demands like a king, and if they are not accepted, threatens with the sword.
dlga_petro_leader_40:petro_leader_40_1|Bodo ist ein guter Mann. Aber er wird dich in die Vernichtung führen, wenn du auf ihn hören solltest.
dlga_petro_leader_40:petro_leader_50|Es ist an der Zeit für dich eine Entscheidung zu treffen.
dlga_petro_leader_40_1:petro_leader_50|Es gab eine Zeit, da habe ich dich geliebt und bewundert. Aber du hast mich hereingelegt und ich werde dir niemals vergeben. Es wird der Tag kommen, an dem du durch meine Hand sterben wirst.
; dlga_petro_leader_50:petro_leader_50_1|I have already expressed my opinion. My men will join the sons of Ragnar and make an alliance with the Danish in favor of Asturias. King Aldefonso will be satisfied.
; dlga_petro_leader_50_1:petro_leader_50_2|I did not bleed for a kingdom destined to perish. I'm with Silo. Join the Danish and ransack West Seaxe.
dlga_petro_leader_50_1:petro_leader_50_2.1|Ich würde es vorziehen, Dänen anstatt Sachsen zu töten... Ja, das ist meine Entscheidung.
; dlga_petro_leader_50_2:petro_leader_51|King Aldefonso named me, his duke, lord of this army, to complete our mission of helping West Seaxe. Barring orders to the contrary, that is our goal, and anything else is treason.
; dlga_petro_leader_51:petro_leader_52|Your people cannot be trusted, Duke Petro. I am Bodo Vimaraniz from Malacoria. You know me, I am a man of the royal court, and here is my seal. I did not want to resort to this...^^I am the word of the king here. I have given an order to have the West Seaxe fleet attack {playername}'s fleet. Look over there and enjoy the show!
; dlga_petro_leader_52:petro_leader_52_2|Silo is a traitor and will be executed. Gundinsalvo will gather and embark his Cantabrians now and prepare for battle. You, Petro, will leave some men here to protect our food supply and send the rest with Gundinsalvo. {playername} shall return to {reg59?her:his} ship to die with {reg59?her:his} men. We will advance from here with our ships in a pincer attack and end this matter. Then we will travel in aid of West Seaxe as agreed.
; dlga_petro_leader_52_2:petro_leader_52_3|You are not the king, and you have ordered an attack without our consent. This breaks all the rules. I'm going with {playername}, but I will not fight.
dlga_petro_leader_52_3:petro_leader_53|Bodo, du hast vollkommen den Verstand verloren! Du schickst diese Männer in den sicheren Tod.
dlga_petro_leader_52_3:petro_leader_53.1|Bis bald.
; dlga_petro_leader_53:close_window|Away with {playername}! Everyone must prepare for battle. Gundinsalvo, go with your men, but if you happen to betray us, you will pay dearly!
dlga_petro_leaderwessex_4:petro_leaderwessex_31|{Playername} willkommen, wir haben dich schon vor Tagen erwartet.
dlga_petro_leaderwessex_31:petro_leaderwessex_32|Der König von West Seaxe schickte ein Niemand. Das ist eine Beleidigung!
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_32:petro_leaderwessex_33|{s2}^^You get offended too easily, Silo.
dlga_petro_leaderwessex_33:petro_leaderwessex_34|Dieser Mann neben mir, Bodo, ist aus Asturien.
dlga_petro_leaderwessex_33:petro_leaderwessex_34_2|Wie viele Männer und Schiffe hast du?
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_34_2:petro_leaderwessex_34_1|{s2}^^Hah! I like someone who gets straight to the point.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_34:petro_leaderwessex_35|Thank you, {playername}, but Petro knows who I am. He has seen me in the royal court. I am one of the king's men, as my seal shows.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_34_1:petro_leaderwessex_34_8|They have more than 500 men and more than 20 boats, many of them obtained from the defeated Danish, {playername}. Petro knows me. He has seen me in the royal court. I am one of the king's men, as my seal shows.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_34_8:petro_leaderwessex_34_9|Yes, I'm glad to see you, Bodo. It has been many years.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_34_9:petro_leaderwessex_35|True, but now you know where I have been. This alliance between West Seaxe, Asturias and Frankia is my work.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_35:petro_leaderwessex_36_1|Glad to see this meeting of old friends.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_35:petro_leaderwessex_36_2|Well, before we leave, we have to talk about that man, Silo.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_36_1:petro_leaderwessex_36_2|Very diplomatic, but we have to tackle a thorny issue. Silo has been providing information to the Danish.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_36_2:petro_leaderwessex_37|What! What are you talking about?
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_37:petro_leaderwessex_37_1|Sigurd Ragnarsson mentioned his name when he spoke to {playername} about a traitor in Asturias who's been sending them information regularly. So Sigurd knew about the letter and my movements. He also knows about this fleet now.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_37_1:petro_leaderwessex_38_1|Everything he says is true.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_37_1:petro_leaderwessex_38_2|Silo should die now.
dlga_petro_leaderwessex_37_1:petro_leaderwessex_38_1.1|(Sagen Sie nichts)
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_38_1:petro_leaderwessex_39|What? You judge and condemn me merely based on the word of this stranger, mere riffraff? By God! I have a noble rank!
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_38_2:petro_leaderwessex_38_1|Kill him? This is a bit hasty, don't you think?
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_39:petro_leaderwessex_40|You should fear what I have to say more than anything else.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_40:petro_leaderwessex_41|Bodo's word means considerably more to me than any other proof or witness. However, we are not in the position to judge or condemn, for that is the king's prerogative. Silo, if you are a traitor, pray God to protect you, for the king won't have mercy. For now, you will be imprisoned and sent back to Asturias with the witness, {playername}, while we will continue on to West Seaxe.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_41:petro_leaderwessex_42|Very well, I will go to Asturias to testify against this man, Silo.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_41:petro_leaderwessex_42.1|Sorry, I can't go to Asturias. I have an unfinished business back in Englaland.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_42:petro_leaderwessex_43|I think no one is going anywhere. If I'm not mistaken, that smoke you see on the horizon comes from our guest's ships. It seems that the Danish have arrived. Maybe now you would understand my strategy.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_43:petro_leaderwessex_44|By the gods! Sorry, I mean my God! Both fleets are maneuvering for battle. The smoke comes from fire arrows.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_44:petro_leaderwessex_45|You must have the eyes of an eagle, Cantabro. We must help our allies before the Danes destroy them. Silo, we need your men on our side, they are the best sailors in our fleet.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_45:petro_leaderwessex_46|You should've thought of that before making grave accusations. My men will fight with me... Well, the Danish brought more boats, and I always ally with the winner.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_46:petro_leaderwessex_48|You traitorous scum! I am taking the overall command. {playername}, return to your ships and try to contain the Danish.

; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_48:close_window|You're insane! You should surrender. To me, my men! For Gallaecia!
; dlga_start:trainer_intro_1|Good day to you {reg59?lass:lad}. You look like another adventurer who has come to try {reg59?her:his} chance in these lands. Well, trust my word. You won't be able to survive long here unless you know how to fight yourself out of a tight spot.
; dlga_trainer_intro_1:trainer_intro_2|Thank you for your advice. This place looks like a training field. Can I learn about fighting here?
; dlga_trainer_intro_2:trainer_intro_3|Indeed, you can. I am a veteran soldier... fought a good deal in the wars in my time. But these days, I train young novices in this area. I can find you some opponents to practice with if you like. Or if you have any questions about theory of combat, feel free to ask.
; dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4a|Yes, I do have a few questions.
; dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4b|Actually, I can move on to practice.
; dlga_trainer_intro_4a:trainer_talk_combat|Well, ask anything you like.
; dlga_trainer_intro_4b:trainer_practice_1|Good. It's good to find someone eager for practice. Let's see what you will do.
; dlga_start:trainer_practice_1|That was a good fight. 
; dlga_start:trainer_practice_1.1|Ha! Looks like you've developed a bit of a limp there. Don't worry. Even losses have their value, provided you learn from them. Shake the stars out of your eyes and get back in there. There's no other way to win.
; dlga_start:trainer_talk|Good day. Ready for some training today?
; dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Ah, are you ready for some training?
; dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk.1|Anything else, {playername}?
; dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_practice_1|I am ready for some practice.
; dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
; dlga_start:trainer_talk.1|Good day, {playername}. How may I help you?
; dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_training_lair0_tr|I'd like to discuss training options.
; dlga_trainer_training_lair0_tr:trainer_training_lair0|I can take your recruits and turn them into warriors.
; dlga_trainer_training_lair0:trainer_training_lair2|I need some men to be trained.
; dlga_trainer_training_lair0:trainer_training_lair4_stop|Please, stop training my men here.

dlga_trainer_training_lair2:trainer_training_lair3a|Wollen Sie, dass ich eine alternative Förderung in Betracht ziehe, wenn diese verfügbar wird?
dlga_trainer_training_lair3a:trainer_training_lair3|Ja.
dlga_trainer_training_lair3a:trainer_training_lair3.1|Nein.
dlga_trainer_training_lair3:trainer_talk|Nun gut, ich werder die Rekruten in {s11} trainieren. Platziere die Männer die dich lehren soll am Ende der Liste in der Garnison.
; dlga_trainer_training_lair4_stop:trainer_pretalk|As you wish, my {reg59?lady:lord}.
; dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|Was wollt Ihr wissen?
; dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have a shield?
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore, you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way, you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [To control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However, you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1|I train novices in four stages, each tougher than the one before. To finish a stage and advance to the next one, you have to win three fights in a row.
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready|You have passed all stages of training, but if you want, you can still practice. Are you ready?
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.1|Way to go {reg59?lass:lad}. With this victory, you have advanced to the next training level. From now on, your opponents will be regular fighters, not the riff-raff off the street, so be on your toes.
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.2|Way to go {reg59?lass:lad}. Welcome to the third training level. From now on, your opponents will be veteran fighters -- soldiers and arena regulars and the like. These guys know some dirty tricks, so keep your defense up.
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.3|You've got the heart of a champion, {reg59?lass:lad}, and the sword arm to match. From now on, your opponents will be champion fighters.

; dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_finish_training|It does my heart good to see such a promising talent. You have passed all tiers of training. You can now tell everyone that you have been trained by the master of the training field.

; dlga_novicemaster_finish_training_2:close_window|I wish you good luck in the tournaments. And, don't forget, if you want to practice your sword work anytime, just come and say the word.

; dlga_novicemaster_not_ready:close_window|Hey, you will never make it if you don't practice.
; dlga_start_craftsman_soon:close_window|Good day, my {reg59?lady:lord}. We hope to begin production in about {reg4} days
; dlga_start:master_craftsman_talk|Good day, my {reg59?lady:lord}. We are honored that you have chosen to visit us. What do you require?
; dlga_master_craftsman_pretalk:master_craftsman_talk|Very good, my {reg59?lady:lord}. Do you require anything else?
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_accounts|Let's go over the accounts.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk|Let's check the inventories.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.1|I'd like you to sell goods as they are produced.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.2|I'd like you to keep all goods in the warehouse until I arrive.
; dlga_master_craftsman_accounts:master_craftsman_pretalk|We currently produce {s3} worth {reg1} peningas each week, while the quantity of {s4} needed to manufacture it costs {reg2}, and labor and upkeep are {reg3}.{s9} This means that we theoretically make a {s12} of {reg0} peningas a week, assuming that we have no raw materials in the inventories, and that we sell directly to the market.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_production_options|Could you explain my options related to production?
; dlga_master_craftsman_production_options:master_craftsman_production_options_2|Certainly, my {reg59?lady:lord}. Most of the time, the most profitable thing for you to do would be to let us buy raw materials and sell the finished goods directly to the market. Because of our longstanding relations with the local merchants, we can usually get a very good price.
; dlga_master_craftsman_production_options_2:master_craftsman_pretalk|However, if you find that you can acquire raw materials cheaper outside {s5}, you may place them in the inventories, and we will use them instead of buying from the market. Likewise, if you feel that you can get a better price for the finished goods elsewhere, then you may ask us to deposit what we produce in our warehouses for you to take.
; dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_auction_price|It will no longer be possible for me to continue operating this enterprise.
; dlga_master_craftsman_auction_price:master_craftsman_auction_decide|A pity, my {reg59?lady:lord}. If we sell the land and the equipment, and liquidate the inventories, I estimate that we can get {reg4} peningas.
; dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_liquidation|That sounds reasonable. Please proceed with the sale.
; dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_pretalk|Hmm. Let's hold off on that.
; dlga_master_craftsman_liquidation:close_window|As you wish. It was an honor to have been in your employ.

; dlga_bardo_cancion2:bardo_pretalk|Never mind. I want to ask you something else.
; dlga_bardo_talk:bardo_bt|I would like to know about the 'Treasures of Britannia.'
; dlga_bardo_bt:bardo_bt2|Well, if you really want to know... then hear me! There are thirteen Treasures of Brittania:^One: Dyrnwyn, White Hilt, the sword of Rhydderch Hael. If a well-born man draw it, it bursts into flame from its hilt to its tip. Moreover, anyone who asks for it receives it. Because of this peculiarity, anyone Rhydderch would offer it to would reject it. Therefore, he was called Rhydderch the Generous.^^Two: The Hamper of Gwyddno Garanhir. Food for one man would be put in it, but when it was opened again, food for a hundred men would be found in it.
; dlga_bardo_bt2:bardo_bt3|Three: The Horn of Bran Galed from the north. Whatever drink might be wished for would be found in it.^Four: The Chariot of Morgan Mwynfawr. Wherever the driver might wish to be, there it would travel, and quickly.^Five: The Halter of Clydno Eiddyn. This was fixed by a staple to the foot of his bed. Whatever horse he might wish for, he would find in the halter.^Six: The Knife of Llawfrodedd Farchog. This would allow twenty and four men to eat at table.^Seven: The Cauldron of Dyrnwch the Giant. If meat for a brave man were put in it, it would instantly be cooked.
; dlga_bardo_bt3:bardo_bt4|Eight: The Whetstone of Tudwal Tudglyd. Any sword sharpened on this whetstone would not fail to kill any man from whom it drew blood.^Nine: The Coat of Padarn Beisrudd. If a well-born man put it on, it would be the right size for him.^Ten and Eleven: The Crock and the Dish of Rhygenydd the Cleric. Whatever food might be wished for, it would be found in them.^Twelve: The Chessboard of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio. If the pieces were set, they would play by themselves. The board was of gold, and the men of silver.^Thirteen: The Mantle of Arthur of Cornwall. Whoever is under it cannot be seen, yet he himself can see everyone.
; dlga_bardo_bt4:bardo_bt5|I would like to find these treasures.
; dlga_bardo_bt4:close_window|Interesting song. Thank you.
; dlga_bardo_bt5:bardo_bt6|Sorry, friend. That is a difficult quest. Most of the treasures were destroyed in Myrdyn's times, and the rest was lost. I doubt they'll ever be found.
; dlga_bardo_bt6:bardo_bt7|Sorry to hear that.
; dlga_bardo_bt6:bardo_bt8|I think you're lying to me. I want the treasure now, or you will die.
; dlga_bardo_bt6:close_window|I'm tired of this, Farewell.
; dlga_bardo_bt7:close_window|An ancestor of mine, Owain map Modred, told me about another man deceived by my ancestor's enemy, Conchobor, centuries ago. He tried to find the treasures in the days of kings Penda and Cadwallon, but was unsuccessful. The treasures are lost, and it's better this way.
; dlga_bardo_bt8:close_window|Do you think if I had these treasures, I would be here serving a king? No, I would be reviving the old knowledge of the Druids and trying to regain the Britannia that was lost with the death of my father. Farewell.

I can even tell everyone how {playername} is truly favoured by Odin, Thor, and Freiya, letting all the kingdom know of your respect for our gods, but you must fund my travels.

; dlga_addonstoryabad5:addonstoryabad4|I appreciate your interest in our orphans, but I cannot answer your question. My patron wants to remain anonymous for now. I will tell you that he is someone important, so important that he sits at the table with kings, and they listen.

; dlga_addonsthesnakedead:addonsthesnakedead2|I know. Our spy sent a messenger with the news. Here is your reward. As you see, my patron is very generous.^^That being said, I have a suggestion. Our spy told us that you had bantered away with The 'Snake' too much. This was a mistake. He could have dissuaded you, and also the less you know about my patron's business, the better it is, for your own sake.
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead2:addonsthesnakedead2_1|Is that a threat?

; dlga_addonsthesnakedead2_2:addonsthesnakedead3|It was just a suggestion. You are being paid well for this work, so it would be foolish to annoy your patron.^^But enough about that. I have another task for you that pays even better.

Two people in particular pose dangers to us - they are Flaithbertach's grandchildren. Your mission is simple: go and find out where they are hiding. As nobody connects you with my patron, you can simply ask the mayor, a man called Donngal, for this information. For this easy task, you will get another 5,000 peningas.

; dlga_addonstoryabad6_1m:addonstoryabad7|--The abbot clears his throat and fixes his eyes on yours--^^At the west end of Eriu there is a village with, err... problems. It is a remote place, near harsh, sea-beaten cliffs and populated by fishermen. Its residents have asked for help because a great evil has befallen them. It shatters men beyond recognition and kidnaps their wives and children.
; dlga_addonstoryabad7:addonstoryabad8|My patron wants you to travel to this village, Bal Luighne, and talk to its leader. He will tell you all the details. Then put an end to the evil in the area and come back here. Nothing particularly complicated, but you will be paid handsomely for fulfilling your mission. To be precise, you will be paid 10,000 peningas for this favor.
; dlga_addonstoryabad8:addonstoryabad9_1|Are there not lords of Eriu that can deal with this problem?
; dlga_addonstoryabad8:addonstoryabad9_2|Can you tell me more about the evil that attacks them?
; dlga_addonstoryabad8:addonstoryabad9_3|Ten thousand peningas? Sounds good, but I want 2,000 extra for expenses now.
; dlga_addonstoryabad8:addonstoryabad9_4|If these people need help, I will go. Without a doubt, I am your hero.
dlga_addonstoryabad8:addonstoryabad9_5|Nein, ich bin nicht interessiert. Verzeiht.
; dlga_addonstoryabad9_1:addonstoryabad10_2|The lords in Eriu are too busy making war on each other, and the area near Bal Luighne is remote and unimportant. I hope my patron didn't make a mistake in selecting you...
; dlga_addonstoryabad9_2:addonstoryabad10_1|I have nothing else to add. The news lacks details, and the fishermen are terrified. I think the area leader of Bal Luighne would be the best person to get details from.
; dlga_addonstoryabad9_3:addonstoryabad11|As you know, money is not a problem, and I apologize for underestimating your needs. Take 2,000 more peningas. Now, we have a deal.
; dlga_addonstoryabad9_4:addonstoryabad11|That's what I expected to hear. My patron certainly was not wrong about you.
; dlga_addonstoryabad9_5:addonstoryabad10_2|I understand, but this is a unique opportunity for you. If you do not accept, another warlord will take the job. Are you sure you're not interested?
; dlga_addonstoryabad10_2:addonstoryabad9_2|Can you tell me more about the evil that attacks them?
; dlga_addonstoryabad10_2:addonstoryabad9_4|Forget what I said. I will go. Without a doubt, I am your hero.
; dlga_addonstoryabad10_2:addonstoryabad10_3|Yes, I am sure. I'm not interested. Farewell.
; dlga_addonstoryabad10_3:close_window|Well, I'm sorry about your answer, but I respect your decision. We will not be bothering you anymore.

; dlga_abadmorrigan_end2:abadmorrigan_end3|Thank you, abbot.
; dlga_abadmorrigan_end2:abadmorrigan_end3.1|Give that money to my men. They deserve all this silver.
; dlga_abadmorrigan_end3:abadmorrigan_end4|I have bad news. The men sent to kill Flaithbertach's grandchildren had succeeded, but when the Ard Ruire, Aed mac Niall, saw the bodies, he said that they were not the right children. Angry, he ordered the men executed. The king knows you were involved, so I would stay far away from his reach.
; dlga_abadmorrigan_end3:abadmorrigan_end4.1|I have bad news. When men sent to kill Flaithbertach's grandchildren came to the farm, they found nobody.

; dlga_abadmorrigan_end3:abad_pretalk|For my part, I have finished my task. Now you must go and see Mael Bresail. From now on, you will deal directly with him.

; dlga_abadmaelbresail_4:close_window|I will be back later.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_5:abadmaelbresail_8|I cannot tell you what I do not know. You can torture me or kill me, but you will not get any further response from my lips.

; dlga_abadmaelbresail_8:abadmaelbresail_5_3|Do not waste my time. Reply now, or I'll kill you and burn your monastery. (Power Strike)
dlga_abadmaelbresail_8:close_window|Ich bin später wieder zurück.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_8_1:abadmaelbresail_6|This monastery has been hard pressed by the attacks of the Vikings, so we need the money. I cannot refuse your donation and believe that this information will not cause harm to anyone. However, if somebody asks me, I will deny talking to you. Mael Bresail is very dangerous.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_5_2:abadmaelbresail_5_5|If Mael Bresail tried to kill me, it's likely he wants to eliminate all witnesses that may link him to the murder of Flaithbertach's grandchildren. Besides me, you are the only one who knows all the details. You are also at risk. If I find your boss soon, your life and mine will last longer. You know I am right.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_5_5:abadmaelbresail_6|But I am only a messenger, an intermediary between his desires and those who execute them! Oh, my God! He wants to kill me, too. Please help me!
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_5_3:abadmaelbresail_6|I know you're capable of such a deed, for I've followed your steps for a while now. Well, I'll tell you where he is, but I am only a messenger, an intermediary between Mael Bresail's desires and those who execute them. Please do not hurt anyone in this monastery.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_6:abadmaelbresail_6_11|There is a place where Mael Bresail feels safe, but ironically it is where he is the weakest, as only a few men travel with him there. Mael Bresail's mother is not Goidelic, but a Briton from Cornubia. She was kidnapped by a war party of the Ui Neill many years ago and was made a wife by one of its leaders, the father of Mael Bresail.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_6_11:abadmaelbresail_7|When his father died, Mael Bresail went back to her homeland and built a house for his mother and a fort for himself, near Bosvenegh. He goes there when he needs to visit or to rest. After what happened recently, he will go there to seek comfort and advice from his old mother. Few know this. I only know because once I had to accompany him to cure his mother. If you find him, remember that Mael Bresail is a reasonable man. Accept what he proposes. Revenge is useless.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_7:close_window|He tried to kill me. Only his death will stop me. Farewell.

dlga_abad_quest1:abad_pretalk.1|Vater, ich fürchte dafür habe ich keine Zeit.
; dlga_abad_talk:abad_action|Pater, we need God to cleanse us of our sins. Here are 500 peningas for widows and orphans.
dlga_abad_action:close_window|Ego absolvo te a peccatis tuis, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sanctii. Amen. Eure Männer werden sich nun besser fühlen.
dlga_abad_talk:abad_talk_conv|Vater, ich würde gerne mehr über die Konvertierung zum einzig wahren Glauben erfahren.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv:abad_talk_conv1|Sure, my son. I will be more than happy to talk to you about the matters of Christianity, but I don't have a lot of free time. Would you consider a donation to our monastery? I think 500 peningas will help my brothers make this place even more beautiful.
dlga_abad_talk_conv1:abad_talk_conv2|Selbstverständlich, hier ist meine Spende.
dlga_abad_talk_conv1:abad_pretalk|Verzeihen Sie, ich habe nicht genug Geld dabei. 
; dlga_abad_talk_conv1:close_window|I really don't see why I should pay you. Good day!
; dlga_abad_talk_conv2:abad_talk_conv2a|Thank you, my {reg59?daughter:son}. Our Lord, Jesus Christ will be pleased. Now, about conversion. You see, each settlement has some mix of true Christians, pagans, heretics and, God forbid, atheists. Every day, events affect people's beliefs. Some turn to Christianity, and others abandon it. That effect is fairly insignificant, on balance, unless there is some kind of force that compels people to choose one way over the others. Certain lords and minor adventurers come with a sword and try to force people to change their beliefs. That, of course, is not God's way.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv2a:abad_talk_conv2b|Our Lord, Jesus Christ, teaches us that any influence we exert on people should come through convincing, preaching and other non-violent means. However, force of threat produces results that are more spectacular, albeit short-lived. This can be improved by compelling people to build a house of worship and hiring a good priest to teach them. Initially, many people may not like that they are being forced to follow our God, but eventually, through God's Word, they change.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv2b:abad_talk_conv3|With persistence and patience, more and more people will turn to the only true faith, just as they have done elsewhere in Europe. The more people are converted, the easier it will be to convert the rest. But please be prepared for setbacks! Initially, it will be a difficult process. If too many people living in that particular place become too angry, they may even riot and burn down the house of worship. Even then, don't despair. Rebuild it and continue with your mission. Also, it helps if your settlement is near a monastery. God bless you, my {reg59?daughter:son}. I pray that your way will be blessed if you decide to follow this path. Amen.
dlga_abad_talk_conv3:abad_pretalk|Habt dank, Vater. Das war sehr lehrreich. 
; dlga_abad_talk_conv3:abad_talk_conv4|You mentioned forced conversion...
; dlga_abad_talk_conv4:abad_talk_conv4a|Yes, my {reg59?daughter:son}. Some of our more overzealous brothers, especially the ones who consider themselves to be great soldiers, think that chopping off a few heads will force people to abandon their beliefs in favor of Christianity. While it may work to some degree in the very short term, inevitably these people will reconvert to their old gods the moment the sword is back in its sheath. If this is the path that you wish to take, I advise that you have a dozen or so clergymen with you to facilitate the process.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv4a:abad_pretalk|Being formidable is important, but it is also essential to be able to speak intelligently and persuasively. Your personality will also play a role. Being bold and courageous should help your case, as opposed to being shy and compassionate. Lastly, I highly recommend that you build up relations with the people first. It is well known that people are more receptive if they trust and like you. May God help you, my {reg59?daughter:son}. Amen.

; dlga_druid_ayuda:druid_ayu|Our gods came largely from two families: the Children of Don and the Children of Llyr. Don was a goddess of the sky, and Llyr was a god of the sea. Don is known as the big mother. Among her children were the god Gwydion and the goddess Arianrod. Gwydion was a god druid, a 'master of illusion and fantasy.' He was a friend and helper of mankind, and a constant fighter against the powers of the underworld, the realm of Annwn.
; dlga_druid_ayu:druid_ayuda2|Arianrod, called the 'Silver Circle,' bore two sons, Dylan and Lleu. Dylan had a great affinity for the sea, and swam as well as the best fish in the ocean. It is said that the waves of Britannia wept for Dylan at his death. Arianrod had poor bonds with her other son Lleu, and his care was left largely to Gwydion. Math, the brother of the goddess Don, was a master of magic and Gwydion's teacher of spells. Do you want to make a sacrifice to the old gods? I warn you that they are fickle.

Farther north, there are only Caledonians and Picts, impoverished and wild people not worth conquering.^^Vallum Aelium was garrisoned by auxiliari, non-legionary troops.

; dlga_start:mayor_talk|Hello stranger, you seem to be new to {s9}. I am the mayor of the town.

; dlga_mayor_begin:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed|{playername}, it was an incredible feat to get the {s14} and the {s15} to make peace, and you made it happen. Your involvement has not only saved our town from disaster, but it has also saved thousands of lives, and put an end to all the grief this bitter war has caused. As the townspeople of {s19}, know that we'll be good on our word, and we are ready to pay the {reg12} peningas we promised.

; dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay:close_window|Oh, yes, of course. We had already got the money for you. Here, please accept these {reg12} peningas together with our most sincere thanks. Me and the people of our town will not forget your help.
; dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay:close_window|You are indeed an extraordinary person, {reg59?madame:sir}, and it is an honour for me to have known you. You not only did what was impossible and put an end to this terrible war, but you won't even accept a reward for it. Very well, I will not insist on the matter, but please know that you will have our eternal respect and gratitude.

; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2|Aye, my scouts saw the whole thing. That should make anyone else think twice before turning outlaw! The bounty is 40 peningas for every band, so that makes {reg1} in total. Here is your money, as promised.
; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:close_window|And that's not the only good news! Thanks to you, the looters have ceased to be a threat. We've not had a single attack reported for some time now. If there are any of them left, they've either run off or gone deep into hiding. That's good for business, and what's good for business is good for the town!

; dlga_mayor_begin:close_window|Good to see you again, {playername}. I have heard that you have delivered the cattle successfully. I will tell the merchants how reliable you are. And here is your pay, {reg8} peningas.
; dlga_mayor_begin:move_cattle_herd_failed|I heard that you have lost the cattle herd on your way to {s9}. I had a very difficult time explaining your failure to the owner of that herd, {reg59?madam:sir}. Do you have anything to say?

; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk|Well -- it sounds like you were able to track down the bandits, and show them what happens to those who would disrupt the flow of commerce. Here is your reward: {reg5} peningas. It is well earned, and we are most grateful.
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.1|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those bandits the punishment they deserved. You are really as good as they say. Here is your reward: {reg5} peningas. I would like to give more but those bandits almost brought me to bankruptcy.
; dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.2|I have heard that you found the perpetrator and recovered my valuable {s13}. You are really as good as they say. Here is your reward: {reg5} peningas.

dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_info_begin|Könnt Ihr mir etwas über Eure Tätigkeit erzählen?
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_dongall_quest1|I've heard that the grandchildren of Flaithbertach are here. Did you know that?
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_dongall_quest6|About Flaithbertach's grandchildren...
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest1:mayor_dongall_quest2|Yes, everyone has heard of them. The children of the son of Flaithbertach mac Niall, the brother of Aed mac Niall, ri h-Erenn uile, called 'Findliath,' or 'Fair Warrior.' Flaithbertach's untimely death gave Aed access to the throne of Aileach. Flaithbertach's family had a bad end too, but two of his children escaped with the two grandchildren. I heard that one of the two who escaped died recently. I feel sorry for him. So very tragic.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest2:mayor_dongall_quest3|Could you tell me where to find them?
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest2:mayor_dongall_quest4|I have some silver that I want to give to this town (1000 peningas)

; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest3:mayor_dongall_quest5|Hiding somewhere where they cannot be found. They have many enemies.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest4:mayor_dongall_quest5|Your gift is welcome in these difficult times. I'll let the people of this town know of your interest in their welfare.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest5:mayor_dongall_quest6|I am very interested to know where Flaithbertach's grandchildren are.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest5:mayor_dongall_quest6.1|I must find them. This silver could help (1000 peningas)
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest5:mayor_dongall_quest6.2|I must find them. This silver could help (3000 peningas)
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest5:mayor_dongall_quest6.3|I must find them. This silver could help (5000 peningas)
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest6:mayor_pretalk|You look like a trustworthy sort, and I do not owe anything to Flaithbertach's grandchildren, but I would like in return service to my community. Make their life better so that they love you in this town, and then we'll talk again.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest6:mayor_dongall_quest7|You have done a lot for this town, and people appreciate you. I give you now what you seek: Flaithbertach's grandchildren are in a farm near Dinas Bran. I don't know why you are so interested in them. They are only two children eight years old. They are alone in life after the death of their father. I understand that Aed Findliath wants to get rid of any pretender to his throne, but these children have no one to support them. They are hardly a danger to him.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest7:close_window|Children grow, Donngal. Anyway, this is none of our concern. Farewell.
dlga_mayor_dongall_quest7:mayor_dongall_quest8|Ich werde diese armen Kinder retten.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest8:mayor_dongall_quest9|Glad to hear that! I interpreted by your words that the murderers of Flaithbertach sent you find his grandchildren. If you go back to them and tell them that you have not found anything, they will continue looking for them. If you really want to keep these children safe, you need to lie. You must go back to Aed Findliath and tell him where the children are. Meanwhile, I could have Flaithbertach's grandchildren moved to another farm and put two young slaves in their place.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest9:mayor_dongall_quest10_1|That will work. Do it.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest9:mayor_dongall_quest10|No, other children aren't the solution.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest10:mayor_dongall_quest11|They're just slaves, but it's your decision. I can find safety for Flaithbertach's grandchildren. I guess you can go back to your lord and tell him where the farm is. They will find the farm empty, but you will have a few weeks before they do. Then you must leave Eriu, where Ard Ruire Aed mac Niall will become your worst enemy.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest10_1:close_window|Very well, I'll take care of everything. Thankfully, the wergild for little slaves is not much. Good luck.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest11:mayor_dongall_quest10_1|Forget what I said. We will follow your idea about using little slaves.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest11:mayor_dongall_quest12|I can carry the hatred of a king better than the weight of the death of two children.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest12:close_window|Very well, I'll take care of everything. Good luck; Ard Ruire Aed is a terrible enemy.
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_historia|Guter Mann, könnt Ihr mir etwas über diesen Ort erzählen?
; dlga_mayor_historia:mayor_historia2|I certainly can. You definitely posed your question to the right man. I grew up here in Lundenwic and have seen the town grow bigger every year. It must be the busiest town in all of Mierce. One can't see the harbour from here, but it's bustling with activity, ships coming in all day long. One can make a nice profit setting up an enterprise here.
; dlga_mayor_historia2:mayor_talk|If one walks further east, down the river, one can see the ruins of the Roman town that once was there, but I wouldn't bother. There's hardly anything left there but rubble and silence now. When the Romans left, they took all the trade and engineering skills with them, so the place slowly crumbled into dust. Fortunately, that's all in the past now.
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_histori|Grüße. Könnten Sie mir vielleicht etwas über diesen Ort erzählt?
; dlga_mayor_histori:mayor_histori2|I surely can. Did getting up here bring sweat to your forehead? I bet it did! You're probably too proud to admit it, but everyone must catch their breath once they reach the town walls. It's not just from being amazed by the majestic size of this place but also from ascending the steep path leading up here. You've come to the royal town of Bernaccia: Bebbanburh. This is where our kings resided centuries ago.
; dlga_mayor_histori2:mayor_histori3|No doubt you understand why it was made the royal seat. With the sea on one side, cliffs on the other and just a narrow path leading up here, it's a well-protected town. Since it was guarded by wise and holy men, it was impossible to conquer. Although I should just say 'wise.' King Aethelfrith, who named the town after his wife Bebba, was certainly not holy. He was the first Northumbrian king and such a ruthless and steely leader of his men, that the natives here, the Britons, called him 'The Destroyer.'
; dlga_mayor_histori3:mayor_talk|He has kept this kingdom together in troublesome times, and he and his son Oswald conquered vast areas of land to the west. Two centuries ago, our kingdom became the most powerful of Britain. King Oswiu gained supremacy over Mercia, becoming Brytenwalda. Those golden days are unfortunately gone. Not too far away from here, there is the holy island of Lindisfarne, where the Danes attacked us for the first time. Ever since that day, we have suffered from their raids. Now our kingdom is under the thumbs of those accursed Norsemen, and our ruler Ecgberht is nothing more than just a puppet in Jorvik. But here in Bebbanburh his influence is minimal, and good people of this town still resist.
dlga_mayor_talk:town_tax|Ich möchte eine neue Steuerrate für diese Stadt festlegen.

; dlga_mayor_talk_cattle3:mayor_pretalk.1|Agreed. The cattle are nearby and just lack someone to fetch them.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk|You already operate a {s4} here, and no one around here is selling his farm.

; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.1|Of course, {reg59?my lady:sir}. You are the lord of this town, and no one is going to stop you.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment|Well... Given your relationship with our lord, {s4}, I think that you will not find many here who are brave enough to sell you a farm.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.2|Well, to be honest, I think that we in the town would like to know you a little better. We can be very particular about outsiders coming here and buying a farm.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.2|Very good, {reg59?my lady:sir}. We in the town know and trust you, and I think I could find someone to sell you the land you need.
; dlga_mayor_investment_advice:investment_choose_enterprise|There are a couple of things to keep in mind. Skilled foremen are always at a premium, so I doubt that you will be able to buy more land here. In order to make a profit for yourself, you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply, but for which the raw materials are cheap. A farmstead can engage in many economic activities, especially in enhancing production of local products.

; dlga_investment_summary:mayor_investment_confirm|Very good, {reg59?my lady:sir}. The farmstead and the materials out of which you can build your {s3} will cost you {reg7} peningas.

; dlga_mayor_info_lord:mayor_info_talk|Our town's lord and protector is {s10}. {s10} owns the castle and sometimes resides here and collects taxes from the town. However, we regulate ourselves in most of the matters that concern ourselves. As the town's mayor, I have the authority to decide those things.{s33}
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_pretalk|Das ist alles, was ich wissen muss. Habt Dank.
dlga_mayor_political_talk:mayor_political_questions|Politik? Gute Güte, die Gilde hat nichts zu tun mit Politik. Wir sind loyale Diener von {s10}.\nWir kümmern uns lediglich um unsere eigenen Sachen, leiten die Bedürfnisse der Dorfbewohner an unsere Lords und Master weiter und manchmal, warnen wir sie vor schlimmen Entscheidungen. Wie auch immer, was möchtet Ihr fragen?
; dlga_mayor_prepolitics:mayor_political_questions|Did I mention that we here are all {s9}? Because I can't stress that enough... Anyway... Is there anything else?
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_war_description_1|Was ist die Ursache für die ganzen Kriege in den Nordlanden?
; dlga_mayor_war_description_1:mayor_war_description_2|Well, to answer your question generally, each monarch claims to be the rightful heir to the title of Brytenwalda, ruler of Englaland. Some of these claims are based on forgotten dynastic marriages and others are based on obscure promises, while some others are forged through sheer strength of arms. So in theory, any one realm has the right to declare war on any other realm at any time.
; dlga_mayor_war_description_2:mayor_war_description_3|In practice, to make war is exhausting work. It is easy enough to lay waste to the enemy's farmland, but crops will grow back, and it is a far different matter to capture an enemy stronghold and to hold it. So the monarchs of the Northlands will fight a little, sign a truce, fight a little more, and so on and so forth. Often, a monarch will go to war when another realm provokes them. At such times, some bad influences who look to enrich themselves with ransoms and pillage will clamor for retribution, and thus the damage caused by war to a monarch's treasury is less than the damage caused by doing nothing would be to his authority... I'm of course not talking about {s10}, as no one would ever question {reg4?her:his} authority
; dlga_mayor_war_description_3:mayor_war_description_4|I would stress again that us merchants have nothing to do with politics. But if {s10} were to ask for my advice on these matters, as a loyal subject, I would tell {reg4?her:him} that while {reg4?her:his} claim to all of the Northlands is truly just, even the most legitimate claim must be backed by armed men, and armed men want money, and money comes from trade, and war ruins trade, so sometimes the best way to push a claim is not to push it, if you know what I mean...
; dlga_mayor_war_description_4:mayor_prepolitics|You may tell {s10} this if you see {reg4?her:him}. Don't mention my name specifically -- just say 'the people of {s4}' told you this. Our personal opinion, of course, as to what would be in {s10}'s best interests. None of us would ever dream of questioning a monarch's sovereign right to push {reg4?her:his} legitimate claims.
; dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_politics_assess|What is {s10}'s policy in regards to the other realms of the Northlands?
; dlga_mayor_politics_assess:mayor_politics_assess_realm|Which realm did you have in mind?
dlga_mayor_politics_assess_realm:mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment|{s11}
dlga_mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment:mayor_prepolitics|{s14}
; dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_internal_politics|What can you say about the internal politics of the realms?
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics:mayor_internal_politics_2|Well, here in the {s4}, we are all united by our love for {s5} and support for {reg59?her:his} legitimate claim to the rulership of all these lands, but I have heard some talk of internal bickering in other realms...
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_2:mayor_internal_politics_3|The lords of a realm often have very different ideas about honor, strategy, and the way a nobleman should behave. In addition, they compete with each other for the ruler's favor, and are constantly weighing up their position -- how they stand, how their friends and family stand, and how their enemies stand.
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_3:mayor_internal_politics_4|Underlying all the tensions is the possibility that a lord may abandon his liege, and pledge vassalhood to another. In theory, each lord has sworn an oath of vassalage, but in practice, a vassal can always find an excuse to absolve himself. The vassal may claim that the liege has failed to hold up his end of the bargain, to protect the vassal and treat him justly. Or, the vassal may claim that his liege is in fact a usurper, and another has a better claim to the kingship.
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_4:mayor_internal_politics_5|Lieges and vassals still watch each other carefully. If a king believes that his vassal is going to change sides or rebel, he may indict the vassal for treason and seize his properties. Likewise, if a vassal fears that he will be indicted, he may rebel. Usually, whoever makes the first move will be able to control the vassal's fortresses.
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_5:mayor_prepolitics|Now, men do not trust a vassal who turns coat easily, nor do they trust a king who lightly throws around charges of treason. Those two factors can keep a realm together, but if relations between a vassal and a liege deteriorate far enough, things can become very tense indeed... In other lands, of course.

As you may have heard, some {s10}s have come across the border to attack our people. {s5} is under great pressure from some of the more bellicose of his vassals to respond with a declaration of war.

But if he charges one of his own lords to respond, then the cycle of provocation will necessarily lead to a full-fledged confrontation. Now, if an outsider were to step in and defeat a {s10} lord in battle, then honor would be done, and it would defuse the clamor for war.

; dlga_start:village_elder_pretalk|My good {reg59?madam:sir}. You tried, but you returned without the slave. I guess you couldn't find him...

; dlga_start:doccinga_interrogation_1|I do not think we can get more information. It seems that your fate, your Wyrd, takes you to Danmark, my friend.
; dlga_start:village_elder_talk_p|{playername}, the prisoner is waiting to be interrogated. He may have some information.
; dlga_start:close_window.113|Wyrd bith ful araed!
; dlga_start:doccinga_thonkrikca|{playername}, you are here! Thank God! Viking ships are coming! It's Sven Bull Neck! He wants to destroy us.
; dlga_start:close_window.114|Sorry, {reg59?my lady:man}. It is late, and I have to be back at home. I will see you with the new day.
; dlga_start:village_elder_thonkrik1|Welcome to {s9}... Oh, wait! You are the {reg59?lady:man} we found in the sea! Nice to see you, most assuredly! I didn't dare hope to see you alive again. That healer may yet prove worthy of the legacy of his father, God rest his soul!
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik1:village_elder_thonkrik2a|Are you Thonkrik? My name is {playername}, and I am in debt to Doccinga.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik1:village_elder_thonkrik2b|Thonkrik from Doccinga? I am {playername}. I have some questions.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik2a:village_elder_thonkrik3|That isn't necessary. No debt, my friend! Rescuing others from distress at sea is the duty of every fisherman! ^We found you unconscious, clinging to a plank and led by the tide. Fortunately, you were not far from the coast.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik2b:village_elder_thonkrik3|Well, {playername}, go ahead.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik3:village_elder_thonkrik4|We were traveling on a ship, the Woden Ric, and were attacked by Vikings! That's the reason you found me in the sea.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik4:village_elder_thonkrik5|I know the Woden Ric! It made landfall at Doccinga many times, because it had passengers seeking cures for the most terrible ills. ^The father of the healer who has healed you was a man well known for his skills in many parts, and thousands of people left everything to come here. Now that man has died, and unfortunately his son does not have his father's magic. ^I am sorry to hear that the Woden Ric was attacked by Vikings...
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik5:village_elder_thonkrik7|I was one of those people. My mother was sick, and now, maybe she... is dead.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik5:village_elder_thonkrik7.1|My mother traveled with me. Did you find other people or... corpses where you found me?
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik7:village_elder_thonkrik8|The sea brings swollen corpses and wrecks to our shores sometimes, but nobody lately. Usually, Vikings take prisoners to sell as slaves...
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik8:village_elder_thonkrik9|Thonkrik, our ship was attacked by Sven Bull Neck. Have you heard of this name before?
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik9:village_elder_thonkrik10|{s1}^^Sven Bull Neck? Oh, my good God! It is a miracle then that you are alive. Sven is a murderer, and his men are demons. He takes no prisoners, kills the whole crew, and burns the ship with the corpses inside. ^He does not look for riches. Sven is more ambitious. Each year we pay a lot of money to him to leave us in peace.
dlga_village_elder_thonkrik10:village_elder_thonkrik11|{s1}
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik10:village_elder_thonkrik11.1|He killed my mother, so now I'll kill him! Tell me, where I can find Sven?
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik10:village_elder_thonkrik11.2|My mother may have been doomed regardless, but he'll pay for attacking ME! Where is Sven?
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik11:village_elder_thonkrik12|{s3}^^To seek Sven? Are you crazy? You are not listening to me! Look around? See those men training here? They are hardened warriors, sent by our jarl! They are here to defend us from Sven's attacks. And we are lucky! Other villages don't enjoy as much importance to the jarl. ^No, no, I know nothing about Sven!
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik12:village_elder_thonkrik13|And so what? They are not looking for Sven. Where is Sven? I want an answer now!
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik12:village_elder_thonkrik15|Thonkrik, I need your help. Don't you know I can help you kill Sven?
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik13:village_elder_thonkrik14|I don't have an answer for you. I am but a simple villager who yet, I may point out, retains his head. If you are so intent on your own destruction, you should ask the jarl of Kennemer. God has given you a second chance, saving your life, but now you intend to waste it. Good luck, but I cannot help more.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik14:village_elder_pretalk|Thanks for everything.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik15:village_elder_thonkrik16|{s1}^^{playername}, look at yourself! You are weak, puny! Almost dead just weeks ago saved by lowly fishermen. You've lost all your possessions. You don't have weapons, resources or men. I don't know where Sven keeps his hideout, but if you go there someday, you will meet your death.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik16:village_elder_thonkrik17|I don't fear death, Thonkrik. I know what I want to do, and it is to kill Sven. Farewell!
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik16:village_elder_thonkrik18|I see you don't know anything. Thanks for everything. Farewell.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik17:village_elder_pretalk|I see the determination in your eyes. Here, take these few coins and my advice along with them: find a job and forget about Sven. Otherwise, feel free to ask the jarl of Kennemer, he might be able to help you.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik18:village_elder_pretalk|You are right. I don't know anything, but you can ask the jarl of Kennemer. Please take some food. You have a long journey ahead of you.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca:doccinga_thonkrikca2|Calm down, Thonkrik! I'm here to help.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca2:doccinga_thonkrikca3|The young people of the village have gathered on the beach with the king's troops to try to prevent the landing of Sven Bull Neck, but they are few. Thanks for coming to our aid!
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca3:doccinga_thonkrikca4|Finally, Sven is near. He will pay greatly for what he did to me.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca3:doccinga_thonkrikca5|Where are the men of {s4}? 
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca4:doccinga_thonkrikca3|{s2}^^Those boats are Sven's, that's for sure. He always leads them. But this many men... I've never heard of Sven Bull Neck attacking a village with so many. It looks like an invasion!
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca5:doccinga_thonkrikca51|{s4} will not come, I know. Some of the people here sent messengers, too, like you and the king, but he did not respond.^^Normally, I would not talk about this openly, for they are Danish problems, but {s4} has left my people to their fate. In fact, I fear that all this is because of him.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca51:doccinga_thonkrikca6|{s2}^^I know people who work in the jarl's house, and it is rumored that he aspires to the throne of Friese... I should not say this, but Sven Bull Neck has been there in the past.^I fear that these boats are attacking Doccinga to bring Sven's warriors to help the jarl capture the throne, but these are just my assumptions.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca6:doccinga_thonkrikca71|Damn traitor. He's been playing with me.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca6:doccinga_thonkrikca72|I'll take care of that issue later. Right now, I have to stop an invasion.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca71:doccinga_thonkrikca72|Be careful with him, he is a dangerous man.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca72:doccinga_thonkrikca72_f|Ic bancie the! Thank you for coming to help, {playername}. I will join my people now. A huskarl from the king leads the defense.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca72_f:close_window|Follow his orders. Please fight with us! Good luck.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_1:doccinga_interrogation_12|What you want to do with the prisoner?
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_12:doccinga_interrogation_mu|Kill him! He is a murderer and does not deserve to live.

; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_mu:doccinga_interrogation_11|It will be done as you have said. As for you, what will you do now?
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_11:doccinga_interrogation_2|In Friese, I'm not wanted. I've earned powerful enemies against whom I cannot fight now, Thonkrik. My priority is my mother. I must save her. I will try finding passage to Danmark on some ship and looking for Sven Bull Neck. Maybe we will never meet again...
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_2:doccinga_interrogation_3|I know you'll be back someday...
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_3:doccinga_interrogation_31|Yes, with an army. The jarls and the king of Friese will pay for what they have done to me.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_3:doccinga_interrogation_32|No, I hate this land. You will not see me again.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_3:doccinga_interrogation_33|It is possible. If I return, I will stop in Doccinga to say hello, friend.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_31:doccinga_interrogation_4|I understand it. You're a {reg59?woman:man} haunted by revenge: Sven, Sigurd, and now the jarl of Kennemer. I hope you find peace someday.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_32:doccinga_interrogation_4|Then, may fate accept that someday you will make your way back.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_33:doccinga_interrogation_4|So I hope! The people of Doccinga love and admire you. Here you will always find a bed to sleep on and fire to warm up by.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_4:doccinga_interrogation_5|Now, I need to find a boat that is traveling to Ribe...
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_5:doccinga_interrogation_51|I can help you with that. One of the Sven's boats was left behind relatively undamaged and has been repaired in secret. It is our gift to you for saving us. The ship awaits you at a beach near Doccinga... and also someone else is waiting for you there. I have a favor to ask, {playername}.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_51:doccinga_interrogation_52|You remember I told you that someone was in the house of the jarl of Kennemer? Someone passing me information? Well that person is my daughter. The jarl snatched her to serve in his house as a maid for his wife. She managed to escape from Kennemer, and now I want you to take her along. If the jarl finds her, he'd take her back to his house, or maybe he would kill her. I need you to do this for me, {playername}, and the boat is yours.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_52:doccinga_interrogation_6|I'll take her with me and will protect her.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_52:doccinga_interrogation_54|No. Where I'm going is no place for a girl. I cannot protect her. She should stay here.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_54:doccinga_interrogation_6|Do not make me beg, my friend. Do you think you have several ships to choose from? There is no other mode of transportation for you. With Sven's attacks, merchants take weeks to come back here. You don't know what they did to my daughter in Kennemer, {playername}... I do not want her warming again the bed of any of the jarl's men. Sorry, but there is no choice: the ship and my daughter go together.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_6:doccinga_interrogation_61|Well, I'll take her and the ship. Farewell, Thonkrik.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_61:doccinga_interrogation_61_f|Wes gesund, my friend.

; dlga_village_elder_talk_p:village_elder_talk_p_f|Sure, Thonkrik. Take me to him. It is time for some words.

; dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_ask_ghost|I am looking for someone who may or may not be a ghost.
; dlga_village_elder_ask_ghost:close_window|A ghost? Hah! Ghosts don't appear during the day! Try finding him at night!
; dlga_village_elder_ask_ghost:close_window.1|A ghost? Ghosts don't appear on their own! You need to walk by him to wake him up.
; dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_ask_music|Have you seen any {s22}-playing guards around here?
; dlga_village_elder_ask_music:village_elder_pretalk|Strangers come and go to our village, {reg59?madam:sir}, but I doubt you'll run into him at this hour of the night. You would have better luck during the day.
; dlga_village_elder_ask_music:close_window|Strangers come and go to our village, {reg59?madam:sir}. Haven't heard or seen anyone like that, but if he is hiding here, you might be able to find him if you look around.

; dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_caliacas1|Caliacas? The abbot of Finian sent me.
; dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_caliacasdesp1|Caliacas? Is everything well? We received your message.
; dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_caliacassuccess1|Your village is safe. You will not have more problems with Morrigan.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas1:village_elder_caliacas2|Ah, the abbot is a good man to respond to our call so promptly! I asked him for three heroes, and in fact, three heroes have come! You are the last to arrive, so you are the most anticipated, since the evil that has befallen our land is terrible indeed. Many have died, others have fled, and the few that remain can hardly keep their sanity.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas2:village_elder_caliacas3|Stop! Three heroes? What do you mean?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas2:village_elder_caliacas3.1|Three heroes? You do not need so many. You have me. Dismiss them.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas3:village_elder_caliacas4|The evil that afflicts us is magical, so we must fight it with magic. Three is the number of the old gods, so the old man said three should be the number of heroes. Any other number will fail and die. At first, we did not believe him, you understand. We are Christians, and our priest said the old man was a pagan and should be burned, and that's what we did. But we were idiots. The old gods are still here, and they want revenge. Now the old man is dead and cannot aid us more, and our priest has disappeared.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas4:village_elder_caliacas5_1|You burned the poor old man? You deserve what you're going through!
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas4:village_elder_caliacas5_2|No doubt, that old man had something to do with this. Better to solve this without him.
dlga_village_elder_caliacas4:village_elder_caliacas5_3|Was sagte der Alte noch?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas5_1:village_elder_caliacas6|Do our women and children also deserve this? And that old man was not poor. He prayed to demons, performed rituals, and sacrificed animals. He lived in a hut from which he sold potions and ointments. Many believe that it was because of him that all this evil is happening to us. That he invoked something... Therefore, when our priest ordered us to burn the old man, we locked him up in his hut and burned it to the ground, listening all the while to his screams and curses.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas5_2:village_elder_caliacas6|We should not have burned him. That old man was powerful. He prayed to demons, performed rituals, and sacrificed animals. He lived in a hut from which he sold potions and ointments. Many believe that it was because of him that all this evil is happening to us. That he invoked something... Therefore, when our priest ordered us to burn the old man, we locked him up in his hut and burned it to the ground, listening all the while to his screams and curses. The only advice he left us was that we should bring three heroes, or the evil that lurks around us will end up destroying us.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas5_3:village_elder_caliacas6|That old man was powerful. He prayed to demons, performed rituals, and sacrificed animals. He lived in a hut from which he sold potions and ointments. Many believe that it was because of him that all this evil is happening to us. That he invoked something... Before our priest ordered us to burn him, he told us that we should bring three heroes, or the evil that lurks around us will end up destroying us.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas6:village_elder_caliacas6_1|You were right to call three heroes then.
dlga_village_elder_caliacas6:village_elder_caliacas7|Welches Böse greift euch an?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas6_1:village_elder_caliacas7|Yes, I think it was the right thing to do. I'm also glad that the abbot respected my reasons, for anyone might have thought us to be heretics.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas7:village_elder_caliacas8|A month or so ago, a shepherd disappeared. A few days later, we found his dismembered body near an old tree. That scared us, because an animal would never do that to a man. After that, nobody left the village without a companion, but that did not help. A few days later, a group of people was attacked. Women and children disappeared, and we later found them dismembered.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas8:village_elder_caliacas9|--His hands tremble as he speaks.--^^Then we hired a group of Norsemen for a lot of money, but evil did the same to them as to our people, and their dismembered bodies were soon food for the crows.^^Then the old man told us to invite three heroes. Then we burned him.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas9:village_elder_caliacas10_1|Did you ask your lord for help?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas9:village_elder_caliacas10_2|You talk about evil. Why suspect the supernatural?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas10_1:village_elder_caliacas10_2|--He sighs heavily.--^^Yes, that was the first thing we did. He sent a group of twenty warriors. They were found dead and dismembered a few days later. Now our lord says he cannot send more men. He needs them for his wars. Since he had left us to our own devices, we asked the abbot.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas10_2:village_elder_caliacas11|The old gods are back, thirsty for blood after so many centuries.^^They have not only killed people and warriors, but we have seen them watching the village from afar. They announce they are coming for us. One of these days, the fog will fall, and then we all will die.
dlga_village_elder_caliacas11:village_elder_caliacas12|{s10}
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas12:village_elder_caliacas13|When there is fog, we can hear their singing and the howl of their wolves. We can even see their figures between dark wisps of fog. The creatures are huge. Well, all except her.
dlga_village_elder_caliacas13:village_elder_caliacas14_1|Sie? Eine Frau?
dlga_village_elder_caliacas13:village_elder_caliacas14_2|(Sagen Sie nichts)
dlga_village_elder_caliacas14_1:village_elder_caliacas14_2|Nein, sie ist keine Frau, sie ist etwas anderes... Die antiken Götter haben sie gesendet um uns alle zu töten.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas14_2:village_elder_caliacas14_2|--He lowers his voice to a whisper.--^^She is Morrigan, the Phantom Queen, the pagan goddess of battle and... carnal encounters. She was worshipped before Saint Patrick brought us the word of Christ.
dlga_village_elder_caliacas14_2:village_elder_caliacas15_1|Eine Schild-Jungfer?
dlga_village_elder_caliacas14_2:village_elder_caliacas15_2|(Sagen Sie nichts)
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas15_1:village_elder_caliacas15_2|What! Please speak lower. Morrigan might hear us. No, she is powerful through magic rather than through physical strength.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas15_2:village_elder_caliacas15_3|My grandfather told me stories about her. The Raven Goddess selects who is going to be slain and takes the blood from their hearts, along with their valor. When they arrive on the battlefield, they are already doomed.^^She appears as a beautiful dark haired woman or sometimes as a crow. A beautiful maiden dressed with a hooded cloak, my grandfather said. She is usually to be found by a river, washing the clothes of men about to die. Centuries ago, she was one of the Tuatha De Danann, the demons that ruled the island before the Gaels arrived. Now she lives in Sidhe, the Underworld, whose entry is the ancient mounds.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas15_3:village_elder_caliacas15_4|She has left Sidhe and has brought her beasts with her. She will destroy us unless some hero defeats her and sends her back to her world.

; dlga_village_elder_caliacas16_1:village_elder_caliacas16_2|She can't be defeated by one hero, so three were summoned. You should find them first.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas16_2:village_elder_caliacas17|The fog always comes from the coast, and with it come Morrigan and her beasts. You have to go there if you want to find her. The other two heroes await you near the burned hut of the old man, a few hours away from this village. They are looking for more clues as they await you. Be warned! When you leave this village and move towards the coast, be alert and flee from the fog, as Morrigan and her animals could catch you before the three of you are joined.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas17:close_window|I pray Morrigan attacks me, so I get my reward sooner.

; dlga_village_elder_caliacasdesp1:village_elder_caliacasdesp2|I'm glad to see you alive. Where are the other champions? I hope they are well. After you had left, we saw go behind you the beasts of Morrigan, and we feared the worst!
; dlga_village_elder_caliacasdesp2:village_elder_caliacasdesp3_1|Yes, everybody is fine. You called me back for this?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacasdesp2:village_elder_caliacasdesp3_2|Morrigan attacked me, but I am fine, and the other champions, too.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacasdesp3_1:village_elder_caliacasdesp4|Err, yes, sorry. I sent the messenger to warn you of the danger. Since you are all well, I guess he succeeded in his mission. My intention was not to cause you to come here, but I understand how you might have interpreted it that way.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacasdesp3_2:village_elder_caliacasdesp4|That's what I thought. Morrigan wanted to take you by surprise. We saw his wolves and bears following in your steps, and a brave lad volunteered to go to the hut of the old pagan to warn you.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacasdesp4:village_elder_caliacasdesp5_1|Well, the other champions will send me notice of where Morrigan's camp is.

; dlga_tort_explained:torture_1|My {reg59?lady:lord}, I can beat and torture your enemies for your pleasure or if you want to make an enemy lord do something. For example, you can force an enemy lord to grant permission to court his daughter or sister, if such permission is hard to gain for you by any other means. Or you can force the lord to grant you parts of his rents from his fief for some time in exchange for freedom. If the lord is pagan and married, you can try to force him to divorce his wife.

; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_4b:village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c.1|Your {reg59?Ladyship:Lordship} will always be welcome in our village, especially if he helps us with this delicate problem. I assure you, our gratitude is not limited just to this invitation.

They take our food and livestock, and kill anyone who doesn't obey them immediately. Our men are angry that we cannot defend ourselves, but we are only simple farmers... However, with some help, I think that some of the people here could be more than that. We just need an experienced warrior to teach us how to fight.

; dlga_start:arena_intro_1.1|Good day, friend. If you've come to watch the tournaments, you've come in vain. There won't be a tournament here any time soon.
; dlga_arena_intro_1:arena_intro_2|Tournaments? So they hold the tournaments here...
; dlga_arena_intro_2:arena_intro_3|Yes. You should see this place during one of the tournament fights. Everyone from the town and nearby villages comes here. The crowd becomes mad with excitement. Anyway, as I said, there won't be an event here soon, so there isn't much to see. Except, there is an official duel every now and then, and of course we have melee fights almost every day.
; dlga_arena_intro_3:arena_training_melee_intro|Tell me about the melee fights.
; dlga_arena_training_melee_intro:arena_training_melee_intro_2|The fighters and knights get bored waiting for the next tournament, so they have invented the training melee. It is a simple idea really. Fighters jump into the arena with a weapon. There are no rules, no teams. Everyone beats at each other until there is only one fighter left standing. Sounds like fun, eh?
dlga_arena_training_melee_intro_2:arena_training_melee_intro_reward|Gibt es eine Belohnung?
; dlga_arena_training_melee_intro_reward:arena_training_melee_intro_2|There is, actually. Some of the wealthy townsmen offer prizes for those fighters who show great skill in the fights. If you can beat {reg1} opponents before going down, you'll earn {reg11} peningas. You'll get {reg12} peningas for striking down at least {reg2} opponents, {reg13} peningas if you can defeat {reg3} opponents, and {reg14} peningas if you can survive long enough to beat {reg4} opponents. If you can manage to be the last {reg59?fighter:man} standing, you'll earn the great prize of the fights, {reg15} peningas. Sounds good, eh?

; dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.1|Hey, you managed to take down {reg8} opponents. Not bad, but that won't bring you any prize money. Now, if I were you, I would go back there and show everyone what I can do...
