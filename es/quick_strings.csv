If all had gone well, our Lord Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' would be sending another 100 men from Danmark, to help {s11} be crowned king. I know only a bit, but I think the jarl of Kennemer promised to send five hundred men on this summer's expedition in Englaland if he becomes king. However, this is no longer relevant.

His ally, the Danish lord, {s11} 'Snake in the Eye,' will not send more troops because he is recruiting for reinforcements to Englaland.

They were the only ones whose lives were spared. Woden, we call Odin.

; qstr_You_came_into_this_w|You came into this world as {reg59?daughter:son} of a declining family of influence. By then, the estates were gone and only the house in which you lived remained as a possession. However, despite your hardships, your parents gave you a good education, preparing you from childhood for the chance to become a companion to royalty.
; qstr_a_travelling_merchan|a travelling merchant
; qstr_You_were_always_movi|You were always moving from one place to another seeking to make a profit. Although your parents were wealthier than most and gave you the best education they could, you found few chances to make friends on the road. When you did succeed to make a friend, you were always glad for the chance to sell them something.
; qstr_a_craftsman|a craftsman
; qstr_Your_father_s_abilit|Your father's ability to make beautiful and useful things were always highly valued by the community. You grew accustomed to live with some comfort and luxuries -- and you can tell a hammer from a mallet.
; qstr_a_priest|a priest
; qstr_You_were_placed_in_t|You were placed in the care of a monastery when but an infant. The brothers were not true parents, but provided care and camaraderie.

; qstr_a_peasant|a peasant
; qstr_You_were_born_into_a|You were born into a small community directed by a nearby lord. Your childhood was happy enough, but there was little time to play. Practically from the time you could walk, you were put to work harvesting cabbages with your frozen fingers.
; qstr_an_outlaw|an outlaw
; qstr_Your_education_was_r|Your education was rather informal. Living in abandoned huts or even along the road, you were put to work begging until you became more useful for cutting purses.

; qstr_Your_family_believed|Your family believed in the Scandinavian gods.
; qstr_You_soaked_up_all_of|You soaked up all of the stories, told far into the night with everyone gathered around the fireplace. You are a staunch believer of the old ways. Your worship gives all the deities their due: Odin, the chief god; Thor, the god of the sky and thunder; Freya, the goddess of love, and all the rest required to oversee all the disparate processes of the world.
; qstr_a_page_at_a_nobleman|a page at a nobleman's hall
; qstr_You_were_chosen_to_b|You were chosen to be a companion to one of the wealthiest nobleman of the kingdom, so were given a place at the hall. Serving the more senior members of the household, your first lessons were in humility. In compensation, there were all sorts of entertainments: chess games, gossip, bards visiting to recite the poems of great deeds and loves. You were drawn most by the world of conflict and competition. You played rough games with other children, batting each other with sticks as swords. Such games provided you invaluable lessons for your current life.
; qstr_a_craftsman_s_appren|a craftsman's apprentice
; qstr_Your_parents_sent_yo|Your parents sent you to learn a trade. After years of hard work and study under your new master, he promoted you first to journeyman and finally to fully paid craftsman for as long as you wished to stay. You became adept with tools and crafting.
; qstr_a_shop_assistant|a shop assistant
; qstr_In_the_employ_of_a_s|In the employ of a shopkeeper, you learned to attract people's interest and convince them with words. Traveling from one place to another in caravans to trade, you learned the customs of very different peoples and proper behavior in each culture.
; qstr_a_street_urchin|a street urchin
; qstr_You_ended_up_in_the_|You ended up in the streets, doing whatever you must to survive. Begging and thieving to earn your bread, daily involved in this violent world, always one step ahead of the law and others who wished to catch you.
; qstr_a_farmer_child|a farmer child
; qstr_You_put_your_strong_|You put your strong back to help with farm work. You learned the land and the livestock that grazed on it. Some years you enjoyed good harvests but others you survived on an empty stomach. You became unflappable and adept at adapting to every circumstance.

; qstr_Formerly_being_a_sla|Formerly, being a slave,
; qstr_your_adult_life_was_|your adult life was full of misery. Forced to do all the hard menial tasks for your owners, you grew to be thick-skinned, fast, and strong. Sometimes your masters gave you no food, and so you had to learn to forage in the wild in order to satisfy your hunger. Your world was small and monotonous. The days seemed to be always the same. Rain and sun punished your body during these endless working days. From sunrise to sunset, with your back aching all the time, your only reward was to see another day, although some of your fellow sufferers were not so lucky. When you got some free time -- something that rarely happened -- you practiced hurling stones with a simple sling. You can hit a dried gourd some paces distant and cause it to explode with a satisfying CRACK.
; qstr_Formerly_you_were_a_|Formerly, you were a priest.
; qstr_When_you_were_not_wo|When you were not working or studying at the monastery, you traveled around spreading the word of God. Anyone who listened to you was greatly impressed with the passion of your sermons. Though you had kept the vow of poverty through all those itinerant years, you never lacked for food, drink or shelter, as the hospitality of the peasants was particularly generous toward a rising {reg59?woman:man} of God. Now and then, the villagers came to the monastery to purchase the unique products that you made. ^^Healing is another of your abilities. Your skill mended many a broken bone and kept many a soul in its body instead of venturing into God's hands. Full of faith, you feel safe outside the thick monastery walls. You are armed with nothing more than a rod or a staff, symbols of the divine ones that comfort you.
; qstr_Formerly_you_were_a_t|Formerly, you were a traveler.
; qstr_Responding_to_the_ca|Responding to the call of the road, you traveled from one village to another, trading whatever you could find. This is not a wealthy life, but you have become a master at getting a good price from even the most miserly of spinsters. Soon, you will be able to create your own trading empire.
; qstr_Formerly_you_were_a_p|Formerly, you were a poacher.
; qstr_Unsatisfied_with_com|Unsatisfied with common men's desperate desire of wealth, you took to your local lord's own forests and helped yourself to their bounty, laws be damned. You hunted stags, boars and geese and sold their meat under the table. You cut down trees right under the watchmen's noses and turned them into firewood to warm many a freezing home during harsh winters. You found that honor is easy enough to barter away for a few hard-to-find silvers. When the hard times came, you foraged for food and became an expert at finding edible plants in the wild.
; qstr_Formerly_you_were_a_f|Formerly, you were a free {reg59?woman:man}, and moreover {reg59?mistress:master} over a bit of land.
; qstr_{reg59?Being_wife_to|{reg59?Being wife to a free man meant that you at least had it easier than did the wives of the servants. You owned some servants who helped you with the hard work, but since your husband didn't own a lot of land, you still had to do a variety of tasks that peasant wives have to do. Your husband had to pay rent to his overlord and owed him labour services for the land. When the lord was involved in a war, your husband had to answer his call for foot soldiers. In those times, he had to rely on his shield and spear in the thick of battle. He often taught you how to fight properly with those arms in case he wouldn't be available to defend your home. :This meant that you at least had it easier than the servants.

Now you must establish yourself on your lands.

A series of events having left the kingdom without a ruler, he proposed you to share the kingship as a compromise between contending factions. You were deliberately chosen to be the minor partner, but a sudden fatal illness of the other share-king has left you sole ruler. Not everyone is happy about this turn of events, and neighboring kingdoms have taken note of the apparent weakness of your realm. Now you must establish your dominion.

; qstr_My_name_is_Beda_the_|My name is Beda the Old, and if you delve into this world, I recommend you listen carefully...^^Britain. The Britons call her Ynys Prydein, the Goidels call her Alba while the Angles and Saxons gave the name of Englaland to the lands they conquered. These islands are large, rich and beautiful... and are coveted. So the land is currently at war and respects only the law of the sword and spear. Realms are born and killed off, and kings die on the battlefield. Women are widowed, and horses carry arms instead of hay. The shouts of warriors fill the air, and the earth lies barren from the trampling of armies. As in past eras of strife, mortal enemies rise, equipped in armour. Ravens are calling, wolves are howling, spears clash and shields answer.^^In the north, the kingdoms of the Angles crumble before the advance of the Danes. The sons of the notorious Viking lord Ragnar, the new lords of these lands, now rule Bernaccia, Deira and Elmet, the land known as Northhymbre. ^^In the south, the Saxons of West Seaxe, led by the Brytenwalda Aethelred and his brother Aelfred, prepare for war. They know that on the other side of the sea, more Danes prepare to cross the ocean in search of fame and wealth. ^^Pushed into the remote fringes of their native land by centuries of landward invasion, the native Britons now are threatened by Vikings on their coasts. They fight desperately not to lose what little they have left, dreaming of a king to unify them all and lead them to final victory -- a new King Arthur. The reality is that their equitable inheritance laws keep the holdings of each lord small and unity harder to achieve. Nevertheless, one strongman, Rhodri the Great of Gwynedd, has begun to impose his will over the rest of Wales. ^^In the lands of the far north, Norwegian invaders thirty years ago wiped out the old competing Gaelic and Pict aristocracies in one fatal blow at a chance three-way battle. After this disaster, Gaelic strongman Cinead McAlpin started to forge a new kingdom out of the two peoples, but they have been driven to the highland center of their former territories. ^^Across the sea, in Ireland, Aed 'Fair Warrior' mac Niall of Aileach has emerged as high king in Temair after overcoming his enemies, but it is nothing more than a prestigious title. His claim is never accepted by the other half of the Ui Neill, and the fighting for land, women and cattle, in the sort of fratricidal wars endemic to that land, continues unabated. Meanwhile, both Danish and Norwegian Vikings have established dozens of coastal strongholds. They use the rivers to plunder the Goidelic hinterland, but they are all too prone to join the native conflict -- on all sides. ^^^The world is chaos, and chaos is war.

; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingd|You are in the kingdom of DANMARK.^^Danmark is an important Norse state in the Viking Age. The Danes not only maintain their independence against the powerful Frankish empire but also attack and plunder towns, churches and monasteries throughout Western Europe. Danish Vikings are excellent merchants who trade with most of their known world. A strong central authority has been established in Jutland, and the Danes now look beyond their own territory for land, trade and plunder. While the men are out at sea, the women manage the farms.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdo|You are in the kingdom of NORTHVEGR.^^In Northvegr, mountainous terrain and fjords form strong natural boundaries. Communities remain independent of each other, and thirty small kingdoms exist in this land. The most powerful leaders of the petty kingdoms have entered a major power struggle. The sea is the easiest way to communicate between the Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world, and the people have become traders and explorers as well as plunderers. The lack of suitable farming land forces Norwegians to colonize the sparsely populated islands to the west. Norwegians carried out the early Viking raids on Britain and Ireland, but later the Danes joined in.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom|You are in the kingdom of LAITHLIND.^^Laithlind is the Norse-dominated part of Scotland and the Northern Islands, conquered by the Vikings three decades ago. This kingdom has become an operating base for Norwegian expansion in the British Isles. On the other hand, internal strife between the various strongmen is common.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_|You are in the kingdom of FRIESE.^^Friese is region along the southeastern coast of the North Sea, the homeland of the Frisians, a people closely related to the Anglo-Saxons by language. The Frisian realm is an important trading region that extends from the north of Frankia to the border of Denmark. The Frisians lost their independence first to the Franks, but now their country is under the rule of the Danish.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_o|You are in the kingdom of WEST SEAXE.^^West Seaxe is the westernmost kingdom of Saxons in Britain. Some decades ago, King Egbert conquered Mierce and secured his overlordship over the king of Northhymbre. He thereby became the Brytenwalda, or high king of Britain. This position of dominance was short-lived, but the expansion of West Seaxe across south England proved permanent. Egbert's later years saw the beginning of the Viking raids on West Seaxe. The Danes were decisively crushed by Egbert's son and successor, King Aethelwulf, in the Battle of Aclea. This victory postponed Danish conquests in England for fifteen years, but raids on West Seaxe continued. Aethelwulf was succeeded by each of his four surviving sons, ruling one after another: Aethelbald, Aethelbert, Aethelred, the current king, and Aelfred, currently sub-king.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of|You are in the kingdom of EAST ENGLE.^^The Kingdom of East Engle is a small independent kingdom in the eastern extremity of Britain, settled by the Angles earlier than many other British regions. It was ruled by the Wuffingas dynasty but was conquered by Mierce. The Vikings ravaged East Engle, but in later years, the Saxons defeated them in two great battles. There then followed a relatively peaceful period in which the Vikings attacked only once. However, the Danes eventually stopped raiding and showed up in force.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_|You are in the kingdom of MIERCE.^^Mierce is one of the most powerful kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons, centered on the river Trent and its tributaries. It was originally composed the border areas, called Midlands, that lay between the districts of Anglo-Saxon settlement and the Celtic tribes they had driven to the west. From the kingdom's capital of Tomtun, the Mercians dominated the Anglo-Saxon realms for three centuries, having annexed or gained submissions from five of the other six Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. That period is known as the Mercian Supremacy. However, the conquest of Northhymbre by the Great Heathen Army has put Mercian dominance into question.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_N|You are in the kingdom of NORTHHYMBRE.^^Northhymbre is the northernmost Anglo-Saxon kingdom. It extended from the south of Alban to the north of the river Humber. It was originally composed of the union of the kingdoms of Bernaccia and Deira, but gradually extended north and west, further encroaching on Celtic realms. The brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless have conquered Northhymbre and installed an Anglo-Saxon nobleman, Ecgberht, as a puppet king.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_G|You are in the kingdom of GWYNEDD.^^The Kingdom of Gwynedd is one of the successor states that emerged during the fall of the Roman Empire and the arrival of the Saxons. Based in Northwest Wales, the rulers of Gwynedd were acclaimed as 'Kings of the Britons' before losing their power in civil wars and invasions. The Britons of Gwynedd remain conscious of their Romano-British heritage, and their kings continue to link their rule to the old imperial Roman order with the continued adoption of Latin and Christianity. Roman knowledge, however, is mainly lost, and the Britons of Gwynedd shift towards a militaristic tribal society. The kingdom has been expanding due to the efforts of Rhodri the Great.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_B|You are in the kingdom of BRYCHEINIOG.^^Brycheiniog is a small independent kingdom in South Wales. It often acts as a buffer between England to the east and the powerful Briton realms to the west. The kingdom was probably founded by Irish raiders, very likely the Ui Liathain, whose power had grown great in Wales until they were reduced by the sons of Cunedda. Currently the kingdom is locked in a feud with its neighbor, Glywyssing.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_A|You are in the kingdom of ALT CLUT.^^Alt Clut is a Briton kingdom located northwest of the Anglo-Saxon realms and south of Alban, along the banks of the river Clyde. It emerged after the fall of Roman Empire with the town of Alt Clut as its capital. With its high, fortified rock (Alt), Alt Clut resisted one attack by the Dal Riata and three by the Picts. An alliance of Picts and Northumbrians finally captured Alt Clut after a siege of several years. However, 18 years ago the men of Alt Clut were able to burn the Pictish city of Dunblane.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_C|You are in the kingdom of CORNUBIA.^^The Kingdom of Cornubia occupies the southeastern peninsula of Great Britain, bordered on the north and west by the Celtic Sea and on the south by the English Channel. Cornubia was the home of the Celtic tribe known as the Cornovii, whose economy was based on tin since ancient times. Separated from the Britons of Wales after the Battle of Deorham, they have been all but eclipsed by the expanding Saxon kingdom of West Seaxe. These people span the Channel, and they take refuge on the continent.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_GL|You are in the kingdom of GLYWYSSING.^^The small Celtic kingdom of Glywyssing was founded out of a western chunk of the former Silures by Eugenius, the son of High King Magnus Maximus. This was the most Romanised part of Wales, although they were descended from the Iron Age tribe of the Silures. Glywyssing is said to be named after Glywys, a legendary early monarch. Lately, it has been locked in a bitter feud with Brycheiniog.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_U|You are in the kingdom of ULADH.^^Uladh is the kingdom located in the north of the island, the homeland of the Gaelic Ulaid, after whom the kingdom is named, and the Cruithne tribes, an early population linked with the Picts of northern Britannia. The Ui Neill dynasty, descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages, are absorbing the kingdom, dominating it from their base in Tir Eoghain.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_L|You are in the kingdom of LAIGIN.^^Situated in the southeast of Ireland, the tribes of Laigin were united by Ugaine Mor, its first historical king, who built the hill-fort of Dun Ailinne. When the Roman legions left Britain, the people from Laigin settled North Wales. For a long time, the rule of Laigin was disputed by two dynasties, the Ui Dunlainge and the Ui Cheinnselaig, but finally the first one got the control of the crown. Nineteen years ago, during a general Norse attack on the British Isles, a Norse army was defeated at Sciath Nechtain by Lorcan mac Cellaig of Laigin and Olchobar mac Cinaeda of Mumain. Nevertheless, the Vikings have created several colonies on the coast.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_M|You are in the kingdom of MUMAIN.^^Situated in the south of Ireland, the kingdom of Mumain is ruled by the Eoganachta dynasty. Nineteen years ago, after multiple defeats by invading Norsemen, Olchobar joined forces with his eastern neighbour, Lorcan mac Cellaig, King of Laigin, to stop them at Sciath Nechtain. Among the dead was one Tomrair, jarl of the king of Laithlind.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_CO|You are in the kingdom of CONNACHTA.^^Connachta is an Irish kingdom situated in the northwest of the island. Conn of the Hundred Battles, a legendary king of Ireland, was progenitor of the later ruling Connachta tribes and the namesake for the kingdom of Connacht. Some centuries later, the ancient line of Connacht kings was displaced by midland rulers, whose centre was at Tara. Two members of this Tara dynasty, Brion and Fiachra, founded clans, the Ui Briuin and the Ui Fiachrach, to which all the current rulers of Connaught belong. Conchobar mac Taidg Mor is from the Ui Briuin branch. Currently, the Norse seem intent on settling an island in the middle of the river Shannon.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_terri|You are in the territory of the Ui Neill of AILEACH.^^Aileach is an Irish kingdom in far northwestern Ireland. The kings of Ailech belong to the northern Ui Neill, said to be descended from Niall of the Nine Hostages. The kingdom takes its name from the hill fort Grianan of Ailech. This kingdom broke away from the Kingdom of Uladh, inhabited and under the sovereignty of the Cenel nEogain tribe. Now in a feud with Ui Neill to the south, the rulers engage in a 'tradition' of alternating the crown of the High King of Ireland between them.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_MI|You are in the kingdom of MIDE.^^Mide means 'middle,' due this kingdom's position in the middle of Ireland. It was created by Tuathal Teachtmhar who, having subdued the rulers of the four kingdoms of Ireland, created his own realm from lands around the Hill of Tara that he annexed from them. Niall of the Nine Hostages later established himself as king of Tara. For six centuries afterward, almost without interruption, his descendants were considered the high kings of Ireland. His son Loegaire succeeded him and welcomed St. Patrick to his court. Niall's sons and grandsons have continued to annex parts of northern Laigin to carve out the sub-kingdoms of Mide and Brega for their descendants. Currently, the Ui Neill of Meath have an arrangement to alternate the crown of High King with their cousins from Ailech, even as they continue to feud.
; qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_AL|You are in the kingdom of ALBAN.^^In the North of Britain, Picts and Scots, with their separate languages, had been traditional enemies. However, both dynasties were nearly destroyed in a chance three-way battle with Vikings. Then Kenneth MacAlpin of the Dal Riata unified the land by somehow finishing off the Pict royal house. However, continued Viking pressure forced him from the coasts and lowlands. He placed the capital of his new kingdom at Forteviot, in old Pictish territory, and moved his religious center to Dunkeld. There he transferred the remains of St. Columba from Iona.
; qstr_You_are_in_territory|You are in territory of the clan of OSRAIGE.^^Osraige is one of the largest clans in Ireland. It was the easternmost region within the Kingdom of Mumain until Osraige warlord, Cerball mac Dunlainge, adeptly obtained independence. Cerball at different times fought and allied with Waterford, Dublin, and Aed Findliath, but generally remains at odds with the neighboring, larger kingdoms of Mumain and Laigin.

; qstr_They_weren_t_good_ti|They weren't good times. In Anno Domini 861, my master, Bishop Swithunus, died. Before he died, he told me that the end of time was coming.^^In 865, a pagan army attacked Cent. Men from Cent managed to placate them, but under the pretence of peace and the lure of money, the invaders pillaged the country nevertheless.^^Later that year, in East Anglia, a large pagan army made winter quarters. The following summer, King Eadmund, eager to see them off, quickly horsed them. This was no raiding party; it became known as the Great Heathen Army. Thousands of men, led by the sons of Ragnar, had come to stay.^^In 867, the end of time started, as Swithunus had predicted. The Great Heathen Army of Danes went over the mouth of the river Humbre to Eoferwic. They captured the town, and there was an immense slaughter of the Northumbrians. Both kings, Osbert and Aella, were slain. So now the Danish rule the north, imposing their laws and pagan ways... Where is God when you need him?^^In the south, the Friese coast was being devastated by Vikings. Merchant ships fled north, seeking the protection of West Seaxe.^^In Ireland and Wales, the pagans were becoming more powerful each day. Many said that the Dal Riata and land of the Picts would soon be no more...

; qstr_Some_merchants_repor|Some merchants report that Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye,' Ragnar's son in Danmark, is bringing warriors on hundreds of boats. I overheard some of the king's advisers in Witan Ceaster saying that the Danish want to destroy all the kingdoms of Englaland.^^The only good news I heard was when a messenger informed us that some Danish sent by Jarl Sigurd to attack Friese were defeated in Doccinga.^^That was the first time I heard the name of {playername}, who had led the defense of Doccinga.^^Little did I know then that {reg59?she:he} was going to be an important figure in my life.
; qstr_There_was_a_man_call|There was a man called Egbert, or I should say a king, Egbert Cyning, for he was king of Northhymbre. But he was a puppet king, chosen by the Vikings because he was a weak man whom they could handle. Was this the fate that awaited us also?
; qstr_In_Anno_Domini_868_t|In Anno Domini 868, the Vikings took Snotingaham. There was fear, much fear, but West Seaxe and Mierce joined forces. Aelfred of West Seaxe, the king's brother, was married to Ealswith, daughter of Aethelred Mucel, ealdorman of the Gaini, and of Eadburh, from the royal line of the king of the Mercians.^^The two realms called the fyrd to war. West Seaxe advanced on Snotingaham from the south, and Mierce joined them on the way. Maybe they could finally put an end to the advance of the sons of Ragnar?^^My life was about to change, but I did not know that.

I was no warrior, but my fate lay with {playername} and {reg59?her:his} men. If we were defeated, we would die with the rest. Fortunately, by some miracle of God, I survived. Too many did not, including Bodo, with whom, I hear, {playername} had spent much time since they first met on a ship called the Woden Ric. I figured Bodo would be a great loss for {reg59?her:him} after everything that had happened, but {reg59?her:his} face was imperturbable, and no one dared to ask {reg59?her:him} how {reg59?she:he} felt.^^After the two battles of Douar-an-Enez, we spent a few weeks in the remains of the village, healing the wounded, burying the dead, and recovering from all that had passed. I really think that times like that are when my work is most needed. Many came to me to find comfort and to thank me for all my words over the dead.^^Then we sailed back to Englaland, where, we didn't yet know, the world had changed...

But even this and what happened next pales in importance when the world lost its hero. I remember it like it just happened, when we entered the hall and watched as Sven Bull Neck finished off {playername}'s mother. I remember {reg59?her:his} face. It became ice cold. Neither anger nor fear nor crying; only coldness. I assure you that Sven Bull Neck turned pale because he knew that his death was inevitable. We fought in the hall and Sven died, but that did not change the hardness of the face of {playername}. Neither then nor later, at the funeral of {reg59?her:his} mother, revered like a queen, and buried with rich grave goods in a warship.^^After that day, we lost our hero. {reg59?She:He} said farewell to us, who we had followed {reg59?her:him} from battle to battle, and said {reg59?she:he} was leaving without revealing {reg59?her:his} destination.^^{reg59?She:He} left us, I fear, to never return. I hope I am wrong, because this dark world still stands in need of {reg59?her:his} exploits.
; qstr_BEDA_CHRONICLE^^{s2}^^|BEDA CHRONICLE^^{s2}^^{s3}^^{s16}
; qstr_Little_news_has_reac|Little news has reached me about the young Caio. I do know for sure that he never returned to Hadrian's Wall, not even to visit his family. Last I heard is that he embarked on a Danish expedition headed to Konstantinoupolis.
; qstr_^^Egil_returned_to_R|^^Egil returned to Ribe, his home, made rich by the spoils of his adventure. He spent all his money on women and ale, and ended up dead in a duel shortly thereafter.
; qstr_^^Brunhild_married_a|^^Brunhild married a Dane, despite having always hated them, and settled near Jorvik. A merchant told me that currently she is a happy mother with three children.
; qstr_^^The_fate_of_Donnac|^^The fate of Donnachdh was dark. He returned to Alban, where he recruited a crew of Scots to pillage the Norwegian merchants in the Sea of Hibernia. The Norwegians of Dubh Linn put a price on his head, gave chase and killed him in an epic battle that the bards still sing about at the court of Alban.
; qstr_^^Morgant_returned_t|^^Morgant returned to Cornubia and sought to unite the clans to try to recover the territory of the old Kingdom of Dunmonia, but was unsuccessful. Many were simply abandoning their homeland for the other side of the channel, which amazingly enough failed to reduce the many rivalries. In the end, he gave up and retired to the monastery of Petrockstow, where I know he took vows.
; qstr_^^Dwywei_was_one_of_|^^Dwywei was one of the few who did not give up after the departure of {playername}, and I know she left in pursuit of him.

; qstr_^^Dwywei_despite_all|^^Dwywei, despite all the past, never resigned herself to the departure of {playername}. I heard she left in pursuit of him.
; qstr_^^Reginhard_returned|^^Reginhard returned to Dorestad where he married Adda, the shopkeeper, and they had a son named Thiaderd. Their marriage was a happy one, but it didn't last. The latest news is that, tormented by his double betrayal, first of Thiaderd and then of {playername}, he returned to his vice.
; qstr_^^About_Clovis_he_re|^^About Clovis, he returned to Frankia where he took land and wife. But he seems to want to forget the past and does not receive my messengers.
; qstr_^^The_beautiful_and_|^^The beautiful and indomitable Solveig decided to continue {playername}'s revenge on the family of Sven Bull Neck on her own. She returned to Danmark, where she hunted and killed all the brothers of Sven, along with their families. The Thing sentenced her to death, so now she's hiding somewhere among other bandits and exiles.
; qstr_^^The_loeknir_the_ph|^^The loeknir, the physician, Asbjorn returned to Odinsve, the home of his parents, weary of war.

; qstr_^^Helgi_was_very_fon|^^Helgi was very fond of {playername}, despite all the past, and when she left, he plunged into a terrible depression. The last thing I know is that he went back east and became a Rus, hoping more blood would soothe his grief.
; qstr_^^Helgi_became_depre|^^Helgi became depressed after the departure of {playername}. Without clear direction, he marched east and became a Rus, looking for his fate in unending war.
; qstr_^^The_Greek_Agathino|^^The Greek, Agathinos, stayed in the north, near Lundenwic. There he got a job rebuilding the old Roman infrastructure. Sometimes I get letters from him. I do not know why we were never friends, but he likes to keep up the relations he made in his past, and I must be the only remnant of another time he has left.
; qstr_^^And_that_is_all_wh|^^And that is all what I know about people who served under {playername}.
; qstr_After_the_departure_|After the departure of our leader, we, {reg59?her:his} followers, dispersed to the four winds. I hid in a monastery in a remote part of West Seaxe, far from it all. Here I will wait for the end of my days. I pay people to bring me news from outside, especially if they find {playername}, but nobody has seen {reg59?her:him}. However, I have a little news from others who were with {reg59?her:him} until the end.

; qstr_{s2}{s3}^^I_hope_my_|{s2}{s3}^^I hope my writings serve to keep {playername} in history. The {reg59?lady:man} who started from nothing, on a ship called the Woden Ric, and rose to be a warlord who was able to put in check the powers of {reg59?her:his} time. {reg59?She:He} it was who killed the dreaded Sven Bull Neck and could be measured face to face with the most powerful men, like the sons of Ragnar and the kings of West Seaxe.^^May the world remember {playername} when the rest of us have all perished.
; qstr_They_say_that_Eriu_i|They say that Eriu is a wilderness, inhabited by people too untrustworthy for truce or trade, and too violent to make it worth conquering. I have heard many stories about Eriu, but none is worth retelling. What I am sure of is that the time {playername} spent there left him scarred for life.
; qstr_Honestly_Mael_Bresai|Honestly, Mael Bresail's death meant nothing to {playername}. {reg59?She:He} continues {reg59?her:his} life largely as if Mael Bresail never existed. Perhaps {reg59?she:he} has a few more enemies among the lords of Eriu and a few extra peningas in {reg59?her:his} pockets, but nothing more.^^But Morrigan was another thing altogether. That woman had something magical. It was not just her singing, which itself was able to freeze time. It was something deeper. When she left, the whole army felt a void. Nobody has ever seen her since, although I know that my {reg59?lady:lord} always hopes for news about her.^^They say many things about Eriu, but nobody tells the legend of Morrigan.
; qstr_The_agreement_with_M|The agreement with Mael Bresail made {playername} a rich person, but his fate was above wealth, and money was only a way to achieve {reg59?her:his} goals. Little news reached us of Mael Bresail after the pact. He always tried to stay out of the way of my {reg59?lady:lord}, even when the affairs of {reg59?my lady:my lord} and his king crossed. I don't know if Mael Bresail just honored his oath or felt sheer terror toward {playername}.^^They say many things about Eriu, but few people remember the legend of how Flaithbertach's children were killed.

That woman had something magical. It was not just her singing, which itself was able to freeze time. It was something deeper. When {playername} killed her, I think that {reg59?she:he} felt {reg59?she:he} had destroyed something that does not belong to this time or world.^^They say many things about Eriu, but few people remember the legend of how Flaithbertach's children were killed.
; qstr_Sandbox_mode_gives_y|Sandbox mode gives you total freedom to choose your gaming experience. You may choose to be a peaceful trader, a fearsome Viking, a king loved by his people or any other role you may want.
; qstr_Starting_is_always_d|Starting is always difficult, so it is recommended to explore the surroundings before heading into your first fight. Visit nearby settlements, obtain quests from local leaders or lords or work to earn a salary at farmsteads, quarries, salt mines or lumber camps. Recruit your first men at farmsteads or monasteries or try to bribe a village leader. You can also buy merchandise at farmsteads and villages and try to sell it in the town markets for a profit.^^It is best to play slowly at first, to explore the possibilities and workings of the game. If you have questions, you can always read the notes.^^Viking Conquest is immense. It will take you into the Dark Ages like never before.

; qstr_In_the_storyline_you|In the storyline, you start as a hero with an uncertain fate.^Please read the following carefully, because the gameplay varies slightly from the sandbox campaign.
; qstr_The_story_follows_it|The story follows its own development path and the decisions you make may affect the world around you in addition to standard game mechanics. This means you won't be able to freely join any kingdom or serve any king, except when allowed to do so.^The behavior of the kingdoms, especially those important to story and in history, will follow the chronology of historical events as much as possible. As a result, these kingdoms may not be destroyed if they were not defeated historically.^Moreover, you won't be able to get rid of your companions, grant them fiefs, or make them vassals, as long as you're playing the storyline. As many of your companions are important to many missions, it is critical that they remain a part of your war band.^^It took many months to build and research Viking Conquest storyline, using historical sources, sagas, and deep love for Viking world. We do hope that you enjoy it as much as we did.

; qstr_You_can_t_sleep._You|You can't sleep. You can hear the constant crunch of the boat hull, smell sea brine, and feel the breeze caressing your face, but your eyes are closed and refuse to open. And your mind keeps dreaming, remembering other times, a past life that feels far away and that you remember less every day, even though not many months have passed since your departure.^^Now, the future is uncertain. Your journey has brought you to the Frisian Sea hoping to find news about an old sorcerer who takes care of all ills, because your mother is sick. For her you left everything behind, a world you knew like the back of your hand, and paid for passage on a north boat, a paunchy merchantman. It's slow and clumsy, but its captain has promised to take you to the remote part of Friese where the sorcerer lives.^^Your mother travels with you; nobody else has joined you. Her illness progresses, and there are days when she no longer recognizes you, but she appears to be completely sound at other times. Every morning you wake up not knowing which day it will be: will you be able to converse with her or will you have to tie her to a post so she does not fall overboard?^^You need to wake up, though your eyes oppose you and your mind boils with fever...^^One more effort. Your eyelids obey...
; qstr_You_can_t_have_more_|You can't have more than two active troop quarters.
; qstr_The_night_falls_whil|The night falls while the ship, the Woden Ric, crosses the ocean. There is a good wind and the Woden Ric enjoys good sailing away from the site of the battle where it stopped in the morning. The Frisian coast is near by the time you fall asleep.^The ship sails during the night while the shift rotates at the rudder. If all goes well, landfall will occur the next day, and you'll be a little closer to your destination.^If all goes well... if only your nights were not filled with nightmares of ships consumed by fire and drowned men floating on bloody water. You are trapped in this way, costing you escape even to the world of dreams, when a hand shakes you, and a voice calls loudly near your ear.^You open your eyes and see the taciturn face of the captain illuminated by the light of dawn.  You see his lips moving frantically and gradually begin to understand his words...^^
