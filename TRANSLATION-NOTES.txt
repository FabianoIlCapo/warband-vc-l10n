The translation is available here:

For know bad thing of warband translation system some strings have "dynamic keys", when one or more of strings change some/all keys of the same "group" are "shuffled".
For example in dialogs they are with keys dlga_start:close_window.N, dlga_wildfire_talkX:*Y and probably others.
Check on transifex suggest corrispondence at 100% for older translation.
I not enabled autocompletation from transifex memory for errors I saw in many strings.
