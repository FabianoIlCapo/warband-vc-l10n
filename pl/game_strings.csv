; str_retirement_text_1|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you fare poorly in several desperate attempts to start adventuring again. You end up a beggar in {s9}, living on alms and the charity of the church.
; str_retirement_text_2|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save. Once every pening has evaporated in your hands you are forced to start a life of crime in the back streets of {s9}, using your skills to eke out a living robbing coppers from women and poor townsmen.
; str_retirement_text_3|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you end up a penniless drifter, going from tavern to tavern blagging drinks from indulgent patrons by regaling them with war stories that no one ever believes.
; str_retirement_text_4|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but you manage to put together enough to buy some land near the village of {s7}. There you become a free farmer, and you soon begin to attract potential {reg59?husbands:wives}. In time, the villagers come to treat you as their local hero. You always receive a place of honour at feasts, and your exploits are told and retold in the pubs and taverns so that the children may keep a memory of you forever and ever.
; str_retirement_text_5|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but it's enough to buy a small tavern in {s9}. Although the locals are wary of you at first, they soon accept you into their midst. In time, your growing tavern becomes a popular feast hall and meeting place. People come for miles to eat or stay there due to your sheer renown and the epic stories you tell of your adventuring days.
; str_retirement_text_6|You've saved wisely throughout your career, and now your silver and your intelligence allows you to make some excellent investments to cement your future. After buying several shops and warehouses in {s9}, your shrewdness turns you into one of the most prominent merchants in town, and you soon become a wealthy {reg59?woman:man} known as much for your trading empire as your exploits in battle.
; str_retirement_text_7|As a landed noble, however minor, your future is all but assured. You settle in your holdfast at {s7}, administrating the village and fields, adjudicating the local courts and fulfilling your obligations to your liege lord. Occasionally your liege calls you to muster and command in his campaigns, but these stints are brief, and you never truly return to the adventuring of your younger days. You have already made your fortune. With your own hall and holdings, you've few wants that your personal wealth and the income of your lands cannot afford you.
; str_retirement_text_8|There is no question that you've done very well for yourself. Your extensive holdings and adventuring wealth are enough to guarantee you a rich and easy life for the rest of your days. Retiring to your noble seat in {s8}, you exchange adventure for politics, and you soon establish yourself as a considerable power in your liege lord's kingdom. With intrigue to busy yourself with, your own forests to hunt, a hall to feast in and a hundred fine war stories to tell, you have little trouble making the best of the years that follow.
; str_retirement_text_9|As a reward for your competent and loyal service, your liege lord decrees that you be given a hereditary title, joining the major nobility of the realm. Soon you complete your investiture as lord of {s7}, and you become one of your liege's close advisors and adjutants. Your renown garners you much subtle pull and influence as well as overt political power. Now you spend your days playing the games of power, administering your great fiefs, and recounting the old times of adventure and glory.
; str_retirement_text_10|Though you started from humble beginnings, your liege lord holds you in high esteem, and a ripple of shock passes through the realm when he names you to the hereditary title of {reg59?ducessa:dux} of {s9}. Vast fiefs and fortunes are now yours to rule. You quickly become your liege's most trusted advisor, almost his equal. You are charged with much of the running of his realm, and you sit upon a throne in your own splendourous palace as one of the most powerful figures in Britannia and Hibernia.

; str_npc1_intro|Salve, Warlord. My name is Caio. My father sent me.
; str_npc2_intro|Heill! My name is Egil.
; str_npc3_intro|{reg59?Who sent you? I'll never go back!:Do not come close to me. I am tired of being abused by every person that crosses my path!}
str_npc4_intro|Tak?
; str_npc5_intro|Hello, traveler. Would you join me for a drink?
; str_npc6_intro|I have things to tell you. Listen carefully.
; str_npc7_intro|Yes? Keep your distance, by the way.
; str_npc8_intro|What do you want?
; str_npc9_intro|You there, good {reg59?woman:man}. Be so kind as to fetch me another drink, eh?
; str_npc10_intro|God thee mid sie, {reg59?madame:sir}! Here's to the doom and downfall of all Welsh!
; str_npc11_intro|Heill, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}. I've been watching you a while.
; str_npc12_intro|Heill, {reg59?madame:sir}. Nice to meet you.
; str_npc13_intro|Yes? What do you need?
; str_npc14_intro|Hail, traveller. I am Ailchu, a Gael warrior. No doubt you've heard of me.
; str_npc15_intro|Yeia sou! Yeia sou! To your health, {reg59?madame:sir}. My name is Agathinos. Are you by any chance heading out of this place any time soon?
; str_npc16_intro|Ah... you... I...
; str_npc1_intro_response_1|Yes, I know. Tell me about yourself.
; str_npc2_intro_response_1|Speak, Egil.
; str_npc3_intro_response_1|Calm down. I intend you no harm. Why are you so afraid?
; str_npc4_intro_response_1|You're not very talkative, are you?
; str_npc5_intro_response_1|Certainly. With whom do I have the pleasure of drinking?
; str_npc6_intro_response_1|Continue, friend.
; str_npc7_intro_response_1|My apologies. I was merely going to say that you look a bit down on your luck.
; str_npc8_intro_response_1|Merely to pass the time of day, foreigner, if you're not otherwise engaged.
; str_npc9_intro_response_1|You must have me confused with another person, sir.
; str_npc10_intro_response_1|Why do you say that, man?
; str_npc11_intro_response_1|Who are you, and why are you watching me?
; str_npc12_intro_response_1|So nice to meet you.
; str_npc13_intro_response_1|To pass the time of day with a fellow traveler, if you permit.
; str_npc14_intro_response_1|Um... I don't think so.
; str_npc15_intro_response_1|I am. What concern is it of yours, may I ask?
; str_npc16_intro_response_1|Are you tongue-tied?
; str_npc1_intro_response_2|Yes, I know that he wants you to join me, but I do not need you. Farewell.
; str_npc2_intro_response_2|I have better things to do.
; str_npc3_intro_response_2|Run along now, girl. I have real work to do -- not whatever it is you fear I'll do.
str_npc4_intro_response_2|Nie.
; str_npc5_intro_response_2|I have no time for that.
; str_npc6_intro_response_2|I have better things to do.
; str_npc7_intro_response_2|Right. I'll not bother you, then.
; str_npc8_intro_response_2|Nothing at all, from one so clearly disinclined to pleasantries. Good day to you.
; str_npc9_intro_response_2|Fetch it yourself!
; str_npc10_intro_response_2|That's arrogant talk, and I'll hear none of it. Good day to you.
; str_npc11_intro_response_2|Oh, I have no time for this!
; str_npc12_intro_response_2|Sorry, I am afraid that I am otherwise engaged right now.
; str_npc13_intro_response_2|Nothing at all. My apologies.
; str_npc14_intro_response_2|No, and I can't say that I much want to make your acquaintance.
; str_npc15_intro_response_2|I'd be obliged if you minded your own business, sir.
; str_npc16_intro_response_2|I'm going. When you learn to talk, let me know.
; str_npc1_backstory_a|Warlord, I am the youngest son of the man known as the old Roman. As you know, my family is a legend in this area. We preserve the history of our ancestors, who patrolled Hadrian's Wall.
; str_npc2_backstory_a|I crave a little of your time, {reg59?madame:sir}. Listen to my story. I am important to you.
; str_npc3_backstory_a|I... I am sorry, but please understand. My life has been a living hell since I became a maid in the house of the jarl of Kennemer.
; str_npc4_backstory_a|I am a man of action. If you want a man of words, find a priest.
; str_npc5_backstory_a|I am Morgant from Bosvenegh. However, I am exiled from my homeland for now...
; str_npc6_backstory_a|{reg59?Madam:Sir}, I should be dead, but I still live while others who should be alive are dead. I came to consider the ship that brought me north, the Woden Ric, as a home, with its crew as my family. So when the Vikings attacked, I grabbed my sword and my shield and prepared to defend them to the death.^^The Cantabrians are Christians, but some of us still remember the old gods. One in particular, Erudino, guides us in battle, and I shout his name while attacking with my sword.
; str_npc7_backstory_a|My luck? You could say that.
; str_npc8_backstory_a|Ah. Well, if you must know, I shall tell you. Not many people around here will listen to good old Reginhard.
; str_npc9_backstory_a|My most humble apologies. It is sometimes hard to recognize folk amid the smoke and gloom here. I still cannot believe that I must make my home in such a place.
; str_npc10_backstory_a|It's a long story, but if you get yourself a drink, I'll be glad to tell it.
; str_npc11_backstory_a|Calm down, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}. It is wiser to be grateful, but allow me to introduce myself. My name is Solveig Olafsdottir. I'm not just any woman. I'm a skjaldmo.
; str_npc12_backstory_a|I think it's a good time to introduce myself officially, since it is likely that our paths are attached. I am Asbjorn from Odinsve, and I am a loeknir, a simple doctor who wasted some time in Frankia until I returned to Danmark some months ago.
; str_npc13_backstory_a|Very well. I do not mind. My name is Helgi, killer of Danes and Slavs.
; str_npc14_backstory_a|You have not? Then perhaps you have heard of my steed, which cuts across the plains like a beam of moonlight? Or of my sword, a connoisseur of the blood of the highest-born princes of Hibernia?
; str_npc15_backstory_a|Well, let me tell you. I'm an engineer who specializes in the art of fortification. If you need a wall knocked down, I am your man. If you need a wall built back up, I am your man too -- but that will take a bit longer and cost you a lot more.
; str_npc16_backstory_a|Excuse me, {reg59?madame:sir}... I am a man of God, a priest of Christ. You are {playername}...
; str_npc1_backstory_b|I, personally, am a very fine tracker. Actually, I am the best tracker around, as my mission has always been to protect my family when we left the caves. Releasing me to your service, my father has done you a great favor.
; str_npc2_backstory_b|I am a son of King Horik, but not a legitimate one. The king likes pretty women, and, well, he met my mother among the handmaids of his wife. So that's how I got here, I guess. I was happy during my childhood in Ribe, but soon the king sent me to live with one of his huskarls.^^The man was tough and violent. He insisted on teaching me how to handle the spear, sword and shield. He didn't let me drink mead or frequent the company of girls. Can you believe someone would inflict such hardship?
; str_npc3_backstory_b|I used to live in a small village, Doccinga. I was happy. My father, Thonkrik, cared a lot for me since my mother died. But, one day, the jarl of Kennemer stopped in our village, and he saw me. He, damn him, forced my father to send me to his house as a maid for his wife. He promised that he would respect me, but he lied. I don't like to speak of this... Well, since then I had really become a slave. I had to give myself to him and then to his men.
; str_npc4_backstory_b|What you ought to know is that my name is Donnchadh of Dal Riata and that I am a Scot.
; str_npc5_backstory_b|For as long as anyone can remember, our family has feuded with another nearby clan. Many men have died in this fight, on both sides, including two of my brothers. The king of Cornubia ordered us to cease, but I know my rights, and my brothers' blood cries out for vengeance. I waylaid and killed an enemy on a mountain path, and I rode out of our hall the same night, without even having the chance to bid farewell to my father. I was later told that the king exiled me and revoked my noble rights. I am now condemned to roam the world, forever banished from my homeland and my kin.
; str_npc6_backstory_b|I'm not an idiot. I knew that the battle was lost. We were outnumbered, and they were better armed, but I asked Erudino to let me kill as many as possible before my trip to paradise. I hoped my sacrifice would allow the others to flee or cause fear among the Vikings, but these Vikings were hardened men who knew their job well. Half a dozen of them surrounded me and beat me while their companions invaded the Woden Ric and killed whomever stood in their way...
; str_npc7_backstory_b|It was my bad luck to be ordered by a stupid Pictish warlord to scout the woods during the night. It was my bad luck that the enemy had laid a carefully planned ambush and considerably outnumbered our small war party. It was my bad luck that I was the only one who managed to escape from the bloodshed. It was my bad luck that the war council deemed me a traitor, and I had to flee from my tribe during the night. It is my bad luck to have you to tell all this to right now.
; str_npc8_backstory_b|I was born in Dorestad. My life has not exactly been easy, but I was happy until my wife and two children died of a plague two years ago. I had a farm, you know, and I sold it because everything in it reminded me of them. Now I'm a drunk and an idiot and no one wants to be with me... well, until you came along.
; str_npc9_backstory_b|I am a Frank, my father's first son, his heir and the bravest warrior in his hall, but when my mother died, my father remarried. His new wife thought that her son should inherit. She could not move against me openly, but the other day I fed a pot of suet that had been left out for me to one of my hounds, and it keeled over. I accused my stepmother, but my father, befuddled by her witchcraft, refused to believe me and ordered me to leave his sight.
; str_npc10_backstory_b|I am a Saxon warrior. I have fought my whole life against the Welsh, and Angles too. The fate of West Seaxe is to govern Englaland. It is the arrogance and hatred of our neighbors that prevents this land from being unified under a single king. The way I see it, only a Saxon ruler or at least a man that does not accept the arrogance of those peoples can truly bring peace to this land.
; str_npc11_backstory_b|By your face, I see you do not know what I'm talking about. Well, I must admit that there are not many like me, and here even less than in my own land, Northvegr. So you can understand, a skjaldmo is a virgin who takes the way of weapons. Also poetry, since poetry and war come from the same impulse.
; str_npc12_backstory_b|On my way back to Odinsve, I landed in Ribe and ended up staying here for a few months, serving the local elites -- and not so elites. I guess my services earned me enough prestige to be summoned as althing in the Assembly held a few days ago.
; str_npc13_backstory_b|I am the second son of a hersir from the land east of Northvegr. I am a Svia Viking. I traveled west to seek my fortune in Englaland, unlike many of my compatriots who seek their fortunes in the East with the Rus. I am good at leading assaults and training men in the art of war. Unfortunately, the jarl here has no taste for the disciplinary methods needed to turn that rabble of his into soldiers. I told him it was wiser to flog them now than bury them later, but he would not listen. Instead, he told me to take my services elsewhere.
; str_npc14_backstory_b|I have always been a warrior, not a farmer or anything else; only a warrior. I admit a modest affection for these lands, and for the past several years, I have visited their towns, forts, and villages, making the most of my particular talents.
; str_npc15_backstory_b|I am also an unfortunate man. I am originally from Konstantinoupolis, far away from here... Maybe you have heard of it. The Varangians call it Mikligard. A few years ago, a group of them kidnapped me and brought me here, to the far north. They made me a slave and sold me to the jarl of Hordaland. I worked for him until a few days ago, when I finally earned enough money to buy my freedom.
; str_npc16_backstory_b|Sorry... I am an idiot. Let me introduce myself. I am Beda. I joined the Holy Church when I was but a boy and eventually became a priest. I believe that even the toughest warrior has a place for Christ in his heart and that I can better fulfill the mission God gave to me in a shield wall than in a sacristy.
; str_npc1_backstory_c|For my part, I can only say that I was willing to travel and see the world. You have given me this opportunity. I am glad that, when my father asked my brothers and me who would pay his debt, I volunteered.
; str_npc2_backstory_c|Now I serve in the royal guard. I'm not particularly happy, since I'm in the shadow of hardened men who won the job by their efforts, while I was granted my position only by the virtue of being a bastard son of the king.
; str_npc3_backstory_c|I so desperately wanted to escape. If only I could start a new, free life...^^I know! You could take me with you! I could help mend the wounds of your warriors. I could even learn to be a warrior myself, if that's what it takes to be free again. Will you take me with you, {reg59?madame:sir}?
; str_npc4_backstory_c|Another important thing is that I do not like Picts. Yes, I know my people are ruled by the kings of Alban, but that does not mean they have become one people. We are Gaels, and not those rats.
; str_npc5_backstory_c|So, as a man robbed of his heritage, any opportunities to earn a living with my sword would be most welcome.
; str_npc6_backstory_c|I saw everyone down: the captain, the sailors, the archers that protected the boat... and I thought I myself was dead until I woke up in the Viking ship, tied hand and foot. I was a prisoner, but thank God, I escaped.^^Now, I am a miserable man before Erudino. I should be dead and the others alive. Now, I just live for redemption.
; str_npc7_backstory_c|But I do not count myself unlucky, stranger, no more than any other woman in this world. This fetid backwater is populated by apes and jackals that do not see that it is worth it to live another day just to kill the hated enemy, and that the way of the tracker and the hunter is better than the way of the ignorant warrior. 
; str_npc8_backstory_c|'Reginhard the Fool,' some call me here. Shit, I shouldn't even be here.
; str_npc9_backstory_c|I hope to offer my sword to some worthy warlord, as it is the only honorable profession for a man of my birth apart from owning land, but in the meantime, I am condemned to make my bed among thieves, vagabonds, merchants, and the other riff-raff of the road.
; str_npc10_backstory_c|Now, if I ever find such a man, I would happily serve in his shield wall.
; str_npc11_backstory_c|The main thing is that I have followed and studied you the past few days. I will join you now. You have a great future ahead, if my intuition serves me well, and I want to share your luck.
; str_npc12_backstory_c|The truth is, I was not interested in coming back to Odinsve so soon, for I am still young and have the opportunity to travel to other places and learn more. The Norns must have noticed and tied together our fates. You need someone who can dress the wounds of your warriors, and I need someone with your fortune, that shines above the rest of the men I've known.
; str_npc13_backstory_c|So, if you know of any warlord whose goal is to win battles rather than pamper his soldiers, please direct me to him.
; str_npc14_backstory_c|Which reminds me -- somewhere out there in the town, an enemy lurks in shadow trying to imprison my free destiny. Namely, an angry, foul, unhappy husband. Not to mention the father, as well. I think there is also a mother, and an uncle. I don't suppose you might consider helping me leave town, would you?
; str_npc15_backstory_c|But after all the years that have passed since I was taken from Konstantinoupolis, I planned simply to stay in the home of the jarl. The truth is that I had formed a relationship with his son. The jarl did not like that and kicked me out.^^So what say you? I see you lead warriors. If you let me join you, I can help when you have a siege.
; str_npc16_backstory_c|I am of Angle origin, from Mierce, but I lived most of my life in Witan Ceaster, the center of West Seaxe. I served for some years in the court of King Aethelbehrt. Honestly, he retained no great men of letters, unlike his brother, Aelfred. I ended up in Dommoc in East Engle, near where I was born, but then the Danish came, and the kingdom ceased to be safe for men of faith. I am an honest and helpful man who always gets along with everyone. What do you think? 
; str_npc1_backstory_later|What do you think? A good tracker is always important, right?
; str_npc2_backstory_later|Have I ever told you that I cannot stand men being served sour milk when there's mead hidden in the pantry?
; str_npc3_backstory_later|Kennemer life was terrible for me. Is that why you are here, {reg59?madame:sir}? To abuse me like every other person that has crossed my life after I became a slave?
; str_npc4_backstory_later|Things got a little clearer. Now if you are interested in recruiting me, I'm interested in anything that would take me away from this dunghill and let me earn a living.
; str_npc5_backstory_later|I've been wandering through this war-torn land, looking for a leader who is worth following. Worthier than the king I am now ashamed of once obeying.
; str_npc6_backstory_later|I have been wandering, but have yet to find redemption. Maybe in war, which I love above all else, I can forget my sin...
; str_npc7_backstory_later|I have been wandering, looking for work as a tracker, but it has not been easy. Britons and Saxons are mostly ill bred, lice-ridden, and ignorant, and it is not easy to work with such people. Not that we Picts are much better... Anyway, I am by far an exception, as you must have already perceived.
; str_npc8_backstory_later|I am still seeking a war leader in whose shield wall I would fight. I need to feel myself between brothers, with the deaths behind me, to forget the family I lost a couple of years ago.
; str_npc9_backstory_later|I've offered my sword to a few lords in these parts, but I find, more often than not, that they ask me to run messages, or train peasants, or some other job not fit for a gentleman.
; str_npc10_backstory_later|I have travelled through Englaland, but I've had no luck yet in finding a man worthy of being my king. At least I got to kill some Britons the other day...
; str_npc11_backstory_later|What do you think? Do you have any idea how lucky you are that I want to join your cause?
; str_npc12_backstory_later|People are in dire need of medical services, but I know my fate is not here.
; str_npc13_backstory_later|I have gone from court to court, but I have not yet found a lord who is to my liking.
; str_npc14_backstory_later|I have been wandering through the towns, leaving a string of lovesick women and cuckolded husbands in my wake. But I grow weary of such simple challenges. I have been thinking of turning to pastimes that are more martial.
; str_npc15_backstory_later|The years in Northvegr were not easy. I used to construct pretty stone buildings in Konstantinoupolis, but in Northvegr, everything was made from wood. Eventually, I discovered that wood can also be beautiful. The Varangians have their own style for their dwellings that bears an intimate relationship to their boats.
; str_npc16_backstory_later|My mission still goes on. Every day, I bring more sheep to the flock of Christ.
; str_npc1_backstory_response_1|I appreciate him giving me a skilled tracker.
; str_npc2_backstory_response_1|Well, perhaps I could offer you work. Can you fight?
; str_npc3_backstory_response_1|Well, I take pity on you, and your healing abilities could be useful.
; str_npc4_backstory_response_1|No Picts in my shield wall, and I might be able to hire an extra hand.
; str_npc5_backstory_response_1|That's the spirit! I might be able to offer you something.
; str_npc6_backstory_response_1|You must join us. Our way should remain united.
; str_npc7_backstory_response_1|Hmm... Are you by any chance looking for work?
; str_npc8_backstory_response_1|I can offer you opportunities and a future.
; str_npc9_backstory_response_1|Perhaps you would like to join my shield wall for a while.
; str_npc10_backstory_response_1|If you're looking for work, I can use experienced fighters.
; str_npc11_backstory_response_1|So you wish to join for luck? Why... of course! Plenty of luck to go around!
; str_npc12_backstory_response_1|A doctor, eh? Yes, you are welcome.
; str_npc13_backstory_response_1|I might be able to use you in my shield wall.
; str_npc14_backstory_response_1|I might be able to use an extra sword.
; str_npc15_backstory_response_1|I suppose I can use such help.
; str_npc16_backstory_response_1|What precisely can you do?
; str_npc1_backstory_response_2|I cannot accept responsibility for you. Go back to him.
; str_npc2_backstory_response_2|Hard luck, friend. Good day to you.
; str_npc3_backstory_response_2|Go back to your master, lass. Forget your old life and accept your destiny as a slave.
; str_npc4_backstory_response_2|No, sorry.
; str_npc5_backstory_response_2|I do not wish to be a new weapon in your feud.
; str_npc6_backstory_response_2|Your destiny is certainly not with me. So sorry.
; str_npc7_backstory_response_2|What I perceive is errant bigotry. Good day to you, madam.
; str_npc8_backstory_response_2|Well, good luck, you drunk. You should look for a new wife or something.
; str_npc9_backstory_response_2|Some of my best friends are riff-raff. Good day to you, sir.
; str_npc10_backstory_response_2|Well, good luck on finding your Saxon king before finding your death. Good day, sir.
; str_npc11_backstory_response_2|Well, I still don't know what a skjaldmo is, but at least now I know I don't like it!
; str_npc12_backstory_response_2|Sorry, I can't take on any new hands.
; str_npc13_backstory_response_2|I'll let you know if I hear of anything. Good day.
; str_npc14_backstory_response_2|No, sorry. There is nothing I can do for you.
; str_npc15_backstory_response_2|I'm sorry. I've got all the men that I can manage right now.
; str_npc16_backstory_response_2|Sorry, priest. You sound like you might be trouble. I respect whatever faith.
; str_npc1_signup|I will serve with loyalty and dedication, I will become worthy of your trust.
; str_npc2_signup|I was trained by Thorgil. Look at me well, because unlike many who are with you, I'm a warrior. I could beat anyone here with spear or sword. I'm worth perhaps five men like yours.
; str_npc3_signup|I am? Will you really help me escape and protect me? Well, I am in no position to be picky! I would be pleased to join you in exchange for my freedom.
; str_npc4_signup|Then I'm your man. Do not ask me to talk too much, but give me an axe and a shield and let me do my job.
; str_npc5_signup|Why, that is a most generous offer.
; str_npc6_signup|Fate is written with blood and steel, and my redemption weaves through them both.
; str_npc7_signup|I might be. I'm not really happy to be here. At first, I thought this would be a safe place, filled with people looking to get away from it all and draw closer to the old gods, but that man, the high druid, is crazy! He kills people for fun, saying that invokes the gods, but the truth is that he knows them very little.
; str_npc8_signup|Thank you, my friend! I know I'm rough. Thank God for people like you giving me a chance.
; str_npc9_signup|I would very much like that, {reg59?madame:sir}.
; str_npc10_signup|Well, I guess I can give you the chance to prove your worthiness. I shall fight for you.
; str_npc11_signup|Oh, luck can't be valued too much. This is a harsh, harsh world. The timid die young, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}, and the bold quickly follow.
; str_npc12_signup|I am glad. I am young, and my thirst for knowledge knows no limits. I hope our travels will help increase my experience.
; str_npc13_signup|I would be pleased to ride with you, at least for a little while, for pay and a share of any loot.
; str_npc14_signup|Indeed? You would do well to enlist me.
; str_npc15_signup|Glad to hear that! I'd be happy to travel, for a change. I'd like to know more about the North beyond this place.
; str_npc16_signup|Well, {reg59?madame:sir}, let me tell you. Inasmuch as my main mission is spiritual, I shall bring peace to every soul in this shield wall.
; str_npc1_signup_2|I've ridden over a fair amount of rough country in my time, more often than not in a hurry. I'm a tracker, so I have a good eye for terrain. So what do you say?
; str_npc2_signup_2|I can also be a great drinker, and I have been praised many times as a skald.
; str_npc3_signup_2|I think you would find that I would be a most valuable addition to your ranks. I am well versed in the old traditions of the land and can declaim several of the epic poems of my people. I will also use everything my grandma taught me to keep my new companions healthy.
; str_npc4_signup_2|If you are clever, you will give me a position of command and keep me far from any Pict.
; str_npc5_signup_2|I shall not betray you -- so long, of course, as you do your duty to me by feeding me, paying me, and not dragging my miserable hide into a battle that there is no chance of winning. Vow to respect me, and I shall be your best warrior.
; str_npc6_signup_2|Erudino has answered my prayers, bringing you to me! You will not find a more loyal companion or closer friend.
; str_npc7_signup_2|But let your followers know that I do not tolerate louts and brutes. Anyone who misbehaves around me will quickly find an arrow in their gullet.
; str_npc8_signup_2|I will earn your respect. You will discover that you can trust me.
; str_npc9_signup_2|I am a gentleman, and I prefer to fight with sword and spear. I recognize that you are of lower birth than I am, but there is no shame for me to serve under an experienced warlord -- presuming, of course, that your followers do not become too familiar with me, nor too jealous of my bravery. I assume that will not be a problem?
; str_npc10_signup_2|You won't regret taking me on, {reg59?milady:sir}. I'm a very experienced warrior, deadly against those damn Welsh. And I've probably trained more raw recruits than you've had hot dinners.
; str_npc11_signup_2|But I am a skjaldmo. I fight like a Valkyrjar and sing as Balder sang before that cunning Loki finished him off mid-stanza. The jarls of Northvegr and Danmark would pay a fortune and their left thumb for me to join them, but the one I choose is you, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}!
; str_npc12_signup_2|It is very interesting how the Norns spin their yarn. Until a few days ago, before the Assembly, I thought I would return home to Odinsve, to end my days remedying wounds and sniffles. Then I met you, and I knew that all this would change.
; str_npc13_signup_2|I am a skilled swordsman. I can also instruct your men in fighting, but I warn you that I do not care to fight for a leader who is lax in discipline with {reg59?her:his} men, for in the long run they will not respect a soft hand. 
; str_npc14_signup_2|Sword, spear, the bow -- my skill in all such martial pursuits is the stuff of epic verse.  Together we will perform feats that will be recounted in festivals and campfires, in filthy taverns and in the halls of kings, for many generations to come.
; str_npc15_signup_2|And you'll be glad to have me. Although siege work is my specialty, I reckon I can handle myself well enough in an open battle. As for besieging, I can truly help you take any place you might want. The fortresses here are rudimentary; they do not compare to the ones in my homeland.
; str_npc16_signup_2|I will be useful in every kind of battle, be it mundane or be it spiritual -- be it against the very hordes of Hell.
; str_npc1_signup_response_1|Good. You can be useful to us.
; str_npc2_signup_response_1|I need no more information, Egil. Just do not give me problems.
; str_npc3_signup_response_1|Hum, that's a start. We can teach you the rest. Hurry, I am rescuing you right now.
; str_npc4_signup_response_1|Very well. I'll be glad to have you with us.
; str_npc5_signup_response_1|Certainly. Those are my obligations to every man under my command.
; str_npc6_signup_response_1|Grab your things. We've lots to do.
; str_npc7_signup_response_1|You are welcome.
; str_npc8_signup_response_1|OK, get your stuff. The way awaits us.
; str_npc9_signup_response_1|Well, it shouldn't be. I'll have a talk with them.
; str_npc10_signup_response_1|Good man, but beware! You will not put down any Briton in my shield wall.
; str_npc11_signup_response_1|Very well, you are hired, but stop calling me '{reg59?my pretty:handsome}.'
; str_npc12_signup_response_1|Then welcome to my shield wall, loeknir.
; str_npc13_signup_response_1|Good. I'll be happy to hire someone like you.
; str_npc14_signup_response_1|Good. Make yourself ready, and we'll be on our way. 
; str_npc15_signup_response_1|That works for me. I will be pleased to hire you.
; str_npc16_signup_response_1|It sounds like you can do the job. I will hire you.
; str_npc1_signup_response_2|I'd prefer not to have you in my army. Good day, sir.
; str_npc2_signup_response_2|No, I prefer a different sort of companion. Good day to you.
; str_npc3_signup_response_2|Actually, I think you are pretty useless. Go back to your master, slave.
; str_npc4_signup_response_2|Actually, we are not in the habit of hiring men like you. Good day, sir.
; str_npc5_signup_response_2|Actually, on second thought, I prefer not to hire a banished man.
; str_npc6_signup_response_2|Sorry, but I do not need you. I prefer not having you around.
; str_npc7_signup_response_2|Actually, on second thought, you sound like you might be trouble. Good day to you. 
; str_npc8_signup_response_2|Mm, maybe you'd best seek your fortune elsewhere.
; str_npc9_signup_response_2|You assume wrong, sir. In my shield wall, we respect courage and skill, rather than birth.
; str_npc10_signup_response_2|I will not see any of my men killed because they are not Saxon. Good day to you.
; str_npc11_signup_response_2|Sorry, milady. Now I remember that we've already got as many singers as we can handle.
; str_npc12_signup_response_2|A battle is not a place for men of science. Perhaps you should look elsewhere for work.
; str_npc13_signup_response_2|My warriors are already disciplined enough without the likes of you. Good day, sir.
; str_npc14_signup_response_2|Actually, on second thought, a fighter overeager for glory and women is dangerous to have.
; str_npc15_signup_response_2|You know, now that I think about it, I won't need your expertise for the foreseeable future.
; str_npc16_signup_response_2|To be honest, I'd prefer someone who is not a religious fanatic.
; str_npc1_payment|I will be very useful to you, {reg59?madame:sir}, you can bet on that. Just one more thing before we leave, would you mind lending me {reg3} peningas? I am ashamed to say it, but I have made myself a bit of debt here, staying in this tavern over the last few weeks, and the tavern owners no longer believe that I am loaded with silver as I used to tell them. You know, things could get ugly here if they see me leaving with you before paying them.
; str_npc2_payment|Before I sign up, I will need 300 coins here.
; str_npc3_payment|Then I will fight your enemies for you!
; str_npc4_payment|Before we depart, would you be so kind as to lend me {reg3} peningas? I had to pawn a family heirloom at a pawnbroker here in {s20}, and I would like to retrieve it before we leave.
; str_npc5_payment|Thank you. Now, to seal off our agreement, I ask for {reg3} peningas from you, so I can adequately equip myself with armor and weapons necessary to fill my new obligations to you.
; str_npc6_payment|Before I sign up, I need 300 coin as pay.
; str_npc7_payment|All right, then. I will come with you, but I want a payment of {reg3} peningas first. You aren't expecting me to work for free, are you?
; str_npc8_payment|Then I will fight your enemies for you!
; str_npc9_payment|That's very good of you, but before I join, can you lend me {reg3} peningas, so that I can buy some proper clothing that befits a gentleman of noble birth like me? The coat on me has worn badly due to my recent bad fortune, and I cannot let common soldiers mistake me as one of their own.
; str_npc10_payment|That's good news, but I'll ask for one last thing, warlord. I have a woman here in {s20}, a happy widow, and she says she has my child in her belly. Damn, she is a Brythonic wench, but I want to give her some money before I leave... for the child, you know. Even if the child's only half-Saxon, it still deserves some future. Do you think you can spare {reg3} peningas?
; str_npc11_payment|Sure, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}, but before joining you, I would like a payment of {reg3} peningas. You know, as back pay for watching over you all this time.
; str_npc12_payment|Before I sign up, I need to settle some agreements I entered into for lodging and the like. Would you be able to cover them? Just 300 coins ought to do it.
; str_npc13_payment|Ah, one last thing. I would like an initial bounty of {reg3} peningas before I join your command. It's my principle never to enter someone's service without receiving the payment I deserve.
; str_npc14_payment|Before I sign up, there is the small matter of some expenses I have incurred while staying here -- {reg3} peningas. Do you think that you could cover those for me, as a gesture of our already legendary friendship?
; str_npc15_payment|Good. By the way, as a skilled engineer, I expect a payment up front. A signing bonus of {reg3} peningas would be fair, I think.
; str_npc16_payment|Before I sign up, I will need 200 coins here.
; str_npc1_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} peningas. Now, fall in with the rest.
; str_npc2_payment_response|Very well. Your loss.
str_npc3_payment_response|Bardzo dobrze.
; str_npc4_payment_response|Certainly. Here's {reg3} peningas.
; str_npc5_payment_response|Well... here's {reg3} peningas, then. Your first payment.
str_npc6_payment_response|Bardzo dobrze.
; str_npc7_payment_response|No, of course not. Here's {reg3} peningas.
; str_npc8_payment_response|Oh, I am no pauper, great warrior. Here's {reg3} peningas for you.
; str_npc9_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} peningas.
; str_npc10_payment_response|Ha ha, of course. Here, {reg3} peningas.
; str_npc11_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} peningas. Now let's get back on our way. And stop... ah, well, forget it.
str_npc12_payment_response|Bardzo dobrze.
; str_npc13_payment_response|All right, here's {reg3} peningas. You are most welcome in our shield wall.
; str_npc14_payment_response|Of course, here's {reg3} peningas. Make ready to leave soon.
; str_npc15_payment_response|All right, here's {reg3} peningas. Glad to have you with us.
str_npc16_payment_response|Bardzo dobrze.
; str_npc1_morality_speech|Oy -- Warlord. Please don't take this the wrong way, but it's a hard life, and it's a bit much that we {s21}. Take a little more care in the future, warlord, if you don't mind my saying.
; str_npc2_morality_speech|I do not care to {s21}. No one with a reputation for blatant cowardice will be properly respected and obeyed by his shield wall.
; str_npc3_morality_speech|Perhaps it is not my place to say so, {reg59?madame:sir}, but I confess that I am somewhat shocked that we {s21}. Of course I realize that war is cruel, but there is no need to make it more cruel than necessary.
; str_npc4_morality_speech|The Scots do not care to {s21}. I will not be pleased if you continue to take this course.
; str_npc5_morality_speech|Pardon me, warlord. It is not good to {s21}. Your first duty is to the men who form your shield wall. The least they can expect is food, pay, the opportunity to loot, and that you not waste their lives needlessly.
; str_npc6_morality_speech|Listen to me, {playername}. As you know, I am a loyal man, with strong values. I will get my redemption. I did not expect to {s21}.
; str_npc7_morality_speech|Warlord, I do not like to see us {s21}. Such are the actions of a common bandit chief, with no regard for his followers.
; str_npc8_morality_speech|I was not pleased that you decided to {s21}. To fall in battle is an honor, but to fight in a shield wall led by a coward is a disgrace.
; str_npc9_morality_speech|{reg59?Madame:Sir}, it is not my way to {s21}. Men of my house will accept death but not dishonor. Please do not make me ashamed to serve under you.
; str_npc10_morality_speech|Begging your pardon, warlord. I can't say that I'm happy to see us {s21}. Those are just simple people, trying to make a living. If we could try to go easy on the poor wretches, warlord, I'd feel much better.
; str_npc11_morality_speech|Excuse me, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}. It's not good that we {s21}. The least the soldiers expect of a leader is to feed them, pay them, and do {reg59?her:his} best to keep their sorry skins intact as best {reg59?she:he} can.
; str_npc12_morality_speech|Warlord, I do not like to see us {s21}. I am prepared to be your hirdman, but not a brigand. Pray let us try to show a little more compassion.
; str_npc13_morality_speech|I do not care to {s21}. No one with a reputation for cowardice will be properly feared by his men.
; str_npc14_morality_speech|Warlord, if we can avoid it, I'd prefer not to {s21}. This world is a small place, and one's reputation is precious. You would have me ignore much to respect you.
; str_npc15_morality_speech|{reg59?Madame:Sir}, just so you know my opinion, any commander with sense will not let his shield wall {s21}. I hope you don't mind me speaking so bluntly.
; str_npc16_morality_speech|Warlord, I don't like to {s21}. God does not approve of this kind of behavior. It will surely cause you to fall if left unchecked by my holy teachings.
; str_npc1_2ary_morality_speech|Warlord, just so you know, I have no problem if we {s21}. Living to fight another day makes good sense to me.
; str_npc2_2ary_morality_speech|You know, friend {playername}, it's none too reassuring to see how you just {s21}. If you can break your word to them, you can break your word to me. That's how I figure it.
; str_npc3_2ary_morality_speech|{reg59?Madame:Sir}, I can't say I like to see us {s21}. There is no shame in finding a way to avoid the spilling of blood.
; str_npc4_2ary_morality_speech|I think nothing of it that you {s21}. You should adopt whatever ruse you need to survive in these troubled times.
; str_npc5_2ary_morality_speech|I think it was a brave decision you took to {s21}. There is no shame in finding a way to avoid the spilling of blood.
; str_npc6_2ary_morality_speech|{playername}, you may choose to {s21}, but I would prefer to have no part in it. Such is not the path to my redemption.
; str_npc7_2ary_morality_speech|I think it was a brave decision you took to {s21}. There is no shame in finding a way to avoid the spilling of blood.
; str_npc8_2ary_morality_speech|I think it was a brave decision you took to {s21}. There is no shame in finding a way to avoid the spilling of blood.
; str_npc9_2ary_morality_speech|Warlord, I am dismayed that you {s21}. A {reg59?gentlewoman:gentleman} such as you should exhibit the highest standards of honor at all times.
; str_npc10_2ary_morality_speech|{reg59?Sister:Brother}, I can't say I like to see us {s21}. If you treat your men well, they'll repay you with interest.
; str_npc11_2ary_morality_speech|I'm not very convinced about the decision you took to {s21}. I was taught that this is a dishonorable solution. I'm confused, but maybe it was just an isolated incident, right?
; str_npc12_2ary_morality_speech|I think it was a brave decision you took to {s21}. You have my support in this, as it does no damage to one's reputation to live to fight another day.
; str_npc13_2ary_morality_speech|Warlord, you should not let it bother you that you {s21}. Armies are made to do their leaders' bidding, and hardships are part of a soldier's life.
; str_npc14_2ary_morality_speech|Captain, just so you know, it's no problem by me that we {s21}. We do what we need to do to live, and they'd do the same to us if they were in our shoes.
; str_npc15_2ary_morality_speech|You know, strategos, it's none too reassuring to see how you just {s21}. If you can break your word to them, you can break your word to me. That's how I figure it.
; str_npc16_2ary_morality_speech|I think it was a brave decision you took to {s21}. There is no shame in finding a way to avoid the spilling of blood.
; str_npc1_personalityclash_speech|Warlord, no offense, but I'm a bit tired of {s11}. She puts on airs like she's something better than your humble servant, Caio.
; str_npc2_personalityclash_speech|{reg59?Madame:Sir}, as you recall, I was living in Ribe. I respect men who like mead and girls, but not men so strict and unbearable. I am talking about {s11}.
; str_npc3_personalityclash_speech|Warlord, in my opinion, {s11} is a terrible man. He has tried to seduce me into his bed many times, and I have already seen him following me during the night, when I am alone. I tell you, I am pretty scared of him.
; str_npc4_personalityclash_speech|{s11} openly shows me disrespect. If things continue along this path, I'll kill him. Be warned, in case you want to take some action beforehand.
; str_npc5_personalityclash_speech|A moment of your time, warlord. {s11} seems to think I'm a common bandit, just because I have rewarded myself in the past to the legitimate spoils of war from caravans passing through my family's lands.
; str_npc6_personalityclash_speech|Your pardon, {playername}, but I cannot keep my tongue still any longer. That harlot, {s11} -- every time she sees me, she points the five fingers of her hand at me -- a peasant's sign to ward off evil.
; str_npc7_personalityclash_speech|Warlord, I have done my best to put up with your followers' rude talk and filthy habits, but that one who calls himself {s11} is beyond tolerance.
; str_npc8_personalityclash_speech|Just so you know, I cannot abide that insolent {s11}, who likes to call himself a 'philosopher.' That southern rat loves to speak in that awful gibberish he calls 'Latin' and laugh at me behind my back because I do not understand what he is saying.
; str_npc9_personalityclash_speech|{reg59?Madame:Sir}, {s11} is a base braggart, a man with as much respect for the bravery of other men as a Svia. I am tired of hearing how he and his fellow warriors could defeat anyone in the battlefield, just because he is a master of military discipline.
; str_npc10_personalityclash_speech|Excuse me, warlord. I hate to trouble you with such things, but I just wanted to let you know that I can't abide that fellow {s11}. He likes to say he is some sort of squire to kings or something.
; str_npc11_personalityclash_speech|Begging your pardon, but I can't keep silent. Not to you, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}. That man, {s11} -- he is stupid, arrogant and fat. He loves battle with bloodthirsty passion, without understanding the honor or poetry of war, despite trying to imitate the bards. He has also made unwelcome advances...
; str_npc12_personalityclash_speech|My {reg59?lady:lord}, that ignoramus, {s11}, has been spreading lies that I am nothing more than a cowardly rascal, unfit for the battlefield.
; str_npc13_personalityclash_speech|Excuse me, warlord. I am very close to killing with my bare hands that insect that calls himself {s11}. That joke of a warrior does not understand how bravery without discipline can only result in defeat and shame.
; str_npc14_personalityclash_speech|Captain, you must be aware that the ugly girl known as {s11} is a disruptive influence to our men. She complains that I have been trying to seduce her. Nothing is farther from the truth, for I cannot stand even her smell.
; str_npc15_personalityclash_speech|Excuse me. I hope you don't mind me telling you, but, in my opinion, {s11} is a danger to the party. He only cares about religion and Hell and is disrespectful of authority and the basic principles of the military art.
; str_npc16_personalityclash_speech|Just so you know, there's something demonic about {s11}. He scrawls strange things in the dirt and mutters to himself the entire time before battle.
; str_npc1_personalityclash_speech_b|She's not somebody special, and she has no right to tell me to keep my distance from her, as she did just now.
; str_npc2_personalityclash_speech_b|I don't much care to hear {s11} gloat about the righteousness of the chaste and pure life. I am a warrior who aspires to Walhalla, not one of {s11}'s saints.
; str_npc3_personalityclash_speech_b|I know that an army is usually a man's place, but I believe I deserve some respect as well. I am no one's whore. I hope you do not mind me saying so.
; str_npc4_personalityclash_speech_b|This Saxon, {s11}, is looking for death. That is all.
; str_npc5_personalityclash_speech_b|I told him that if the warrior's way bothers him so much, he should become a priest or a beggar so as not to have to worry about such things. I hope you do not mind that I say such things.
; str_npc6_personalityclash_speech_b|I know I'm not the best of men, but I am seeking repentance, and I deserve better than to be the object of some witch's superstition. I think she has some devil's blood in her possession. I just thought you should know.
; str_npc7_personalityclash_speech_b|I do not care for how he stares at me around the camp fire after a meal, picking his teeth and slurping his slimy beer. What I cannot accept is how he keeps saying that he is a much better tracker than I am, which is obviously false. He is base, ignorant, and a completely idiotic youth. He could never compare to me in tracking, nor in anything else. I do not care to travel with such people.
; str_npc8_personalityclash_speech_b|It is true I do not know how to read and write, nor how to speak Latin, but I know much more of life and battle than {s11}. A great warrior like me should not be mocked by some weak-minded schoolboy. It was only out of respect for you that I refrained from cutting his throat when I overheard his jokes about me. I thought it only fitting that I should warn you.
; str_npc9_personalityclash_speech_b|So I asked him, if he and his men were so much more disciplined than even the Franks, how did he fail to conquer his Danish enemies and instead ran to hide among the Saxons, a people that he despises? He gave me no reply; his face just turned red. Then he cursed me and all of my ancestors and almost challenged me to a duel. He says he is so disciplined, but I think maybe you should discipline him a little more.
; str_npc10_personalityclash_speech_b|Everyone knows there is no noble blood among the Welsh; the two things are antithetical. Any Welshman who pretends to be of noble blood is simple, foolish, and intolerable. Anyway, I might have said something that was a bit sharp to him a moment ago - something like 'if he is truly a noble, then his father must really be a Saxon.' He seemed to take offense. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
; str_npc11_personalityclash_speech_b|He'll bring us nothing but misfortune and sorrow, that's for certain. I don't like being around him, and I don't think he should be with us. I have also instructed him that a skjaldmo must be a virgin, but he stupidly keeps speaking of love. I cannot abide him any longer, that's all. Sorry to have to trouble you with this, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}.
; str_npc12_personalityclash_speech_b|It is not my fault that this stupid barbarian is incapable of understanding the beautiful world of medicine, nor that he prefers to die with an infected wound than to be helped by my knowledge of nature and human body. Warlord, I am deeply tired of tolerating such an ungrateful and ignorant lot.
; str_npc13_personalityclash_speech_b|That schit {s11} saw fit to mock the war-like nature of my people, and even suggested that I am in Englaland only because I was defeated in the battlefield fighting against the Danish, which, of course, has never happened. I will not have my methods nor my beliefs questioned in front of the men, and I will not serve any warlord who tolerates such insubordination and stupidity in his shield wall. Thank you for allowing me to speak my piece.
; str_npc14_personalityclash_speech_b|She is the one that has already tried many times to sneak into my tent during the night! She uses every opportunity to be alone with me, trying to provoke me into something I do not dare to say out loud. Please, explain to that impudent girl that I only care for beautiful women and would have no business with the likes of her.
; str_npc15_personalityclash_speech_b|I heard him preaching to the warriors that our preparations before a battle or a siege are completely useless, because victory can only be achieved if it befits God's will. Even though I also believe in Christ, I know for sure that a pure Christian soul alone never guaranteed victory to any army. I think you should tell him to stop this kind of preaching right now.
; str_npc16_personalityclash_speech_b|Fearing witchcraft, I asked {s11} about it, and he told me that I should mind my own business. So I had a look in his baggage and found a heretical Odin amulet. I am sure that this amulet is evil, a thing of the Devil, surely. We should definitely get rid of {s11} for the sake of our immortal souls.
; str_npc1_personalityclash2_speech|Warlord, no offense, but I'm a bit tired of {s11}. He keeps saying that I am a crazy, idiotic youth that is surely doomed to go to Hell.
; str_npc2_personalityclash2_speech|{reg59?Madame:Sir}, if you don't mind, I'd prefer not to be deployed anywhere near {s11}, lest I be tempted to sacrifice him to my gods.
; str_npc3_personalityclash2_speech|{reg59?Madame:Sir}, since I joined your shield wall, I have tried hard to learn how to live like a soldier -- which is much better than being a slave -- and how to honor the warrior's code, but some of your men do not respect me as an equal.
; str_npc4_personalityclash2_speech|I told you I hate Picts, yet you invited {s11} to join us. Well, inform her that when she speaks to me, she should remember that she is nothing more than a Pictish servant, whereas I am a Scot.
; str_npc5_personalityclash2_speech|Warlord, {s11} needs to have her tongue cut out and her back whipped hard.
; str_npc6_personalityclash2_speech|Did you see {s11} during that last battle? He taunts the fallen foe as they lie stricken and helpless on the battlefield, mocking their parentage and their foolishness for having fought us. He is becoming completely depraved and weak, just like all his race are.
; str_npc7_personalityclash2_speech|Warlord, I have grown tired of the insolence of the man that answers to the name of {s11}. He thinks I am less a warrior than he just because I am a tracker and, even more, a woman. Yes, I know it's not common for a woman to leave her home and her husband, but where I come from, among the Picts, women have few options, but definitely more than in other, ignorant lands.
; str_npc8_personalityclash2_speech|Warlord. {s11} is a most insolent girl. I have tried to be polite, even friendly, only to have her rebuff me. The little chit thinks she is a warrior, and not just a camp slave.
; str_npc9_personalityclash2_speech|{reg59?My lady:Sir}, I hope you do not mind me telling you this, but in my opinion {s11}, the bastard, does not know his place. During that last battle, he cut in front of me to engage a foe whom I had marked as my own.
; str_npc10_personalityclash2_speech|Warlord, a question for you. Are you in charge of this shield wall, or is it {s11}?
; str_npc11_personalityclash2_speech|{reg59?My pretty:Handsome}, I do not think we should keep the company of that fellow {s11}. Please, hear what I feel in my heart.
; str_npc12_personalityclash2_speech|Warlord. I can no longer abide the rank ignorance of {s11}. As I was treating the wounded during our last battle, he saw fit to disparage my use of laudanum in relieving the pain while I conducted surgery and of treating wounds with a poultice of honey.
; str_npc13_personalityclash2_speech|I must say that the presence of {s11} offends me. He, a Dane, mocks one of the confrontations between my people and his. We were completely defeated that time, and he knows I fought there.
; str_npc14_personalityclash2_speech|{reg59?Madame:Sir}, {s11} is a terrible companion. He does not deserve the honor of being part of the glorious saga of our shield wall, which shall be sung for generations to come and forever more.
; str_npc15_personalityclash2_speech|Strategos, I must tell you that I question {s11}'s medical credentials. As he was tending to our wounded after that last battle, I saw fit to remind him that the peerless Hippocrates often advocated administering a distillation of beetroot, to restore the humor imbalance brought by loss of sanguinity.
; str_npc16_personalityclash2_speech|If you have any fear of God, pay heed to the warnings I am about to speak. The demon called {s11} must be put to death right now.
; str_npc1_personalityclash2_speech_b|I have no interest in becoming a Christian. In my opinion, this priest only can only bring us bad luck. Maybe we should burn him.
; str_npc2_personalityclash2_speech_b|The enemy was bearing down on us, and he says, 'A great warrior does not drink mead in battle.' Next time I will step aside, and let him take a spear in the gut.
; str_npc3_personalityclash2_speech_b|After our last victory, I was picking through the slain, and that Frisian called Reginhard pushed me aside, saying that looting was not for me, a simple slave girl that has just been permitted to travel with the army. However, I believe that if I battle in the shield wall, I deserve my share of the loot, just like any other warrior. Even though I might be less experienced than the others, I also risked my life.
; str_npc4_personalityclash2_speech_b|Finally, you will have to deal with that northern woman. She must remember her place or be whipped.
; str_npc5_personalityclash2_speech_b|As far as I understand, she is but a woman. Yet, when I ordered her to fetch me a bowl of that fine stew last night, she refused and said that I should get it myself. I was too tired to slap her properly for her impudence, so I let it go, but I will not tolerate such disrespect in the future.
; str_npc6_personalityclash2_speech_b|We should not tolerate that bastard in our shield wall. The battle is no place for mockers; no true warrior insults a fallen foe. Please, let me kill this idiot. Allow me to appease my tortured soul with this sinner's blood.
; str_npc7_personalityclash2_speech_b|He also insists that I should address him as 'my lord,' instead of his ridiculous name. I tell you, one day, when I have my own band of warriors, I will hunt him down and ask him how much better a warrior he is with my axe buried in his skull.
; str_npc8_personalityclash2_speech_b|As we were cleaning our weapons after that last battle, I remarked that I thought her a handsome girl and that I would happily find her a place with one of my renters. I explained to her that, although I, myself, am looking for a wife, I will marry only a free woman. I thought it was a very generous offer, a man and land. An army slave is hardly going to find herself awash in prospects, but rather than thank me, she simply turned her back without a word. It was only out of respect for your leadership that I did not immediately try to teach her some manners. I really think you should discipline your slaves better.
; str_npc9_personalityclash2_speech_b|I appreciate that he is willing to risk his life in battle, but that alone does not make a warrior. He is not of noble birth. He may fight with us as an auxiliary, as a favor, but he should not attempt to steal glory from his betters.
; str_npc10_personalityclash2_speech_b|In that last battle, as always, he kept singing and praising himself as the glorious commander that lead us all to victory, fame, and fortune. I am sorry, but if he is our leader instead of you, I am ready to go find my fortune somewhere else.
; str_npc11_personalityclash2_speech_b|As far as I know, he is an exiled man that will never find peace nor truly be allowed to return to his homeland. All because he was unable to obey his jarl. Well, if he can't obey even his rightful jarl, what says that he shall obey you? Please, don't take me wrong, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}, but I think he is a danger to us all. I think you had best be rid of him.
; str_npc12_personalityclash2_speech_b|Warlord, if that man knew the slightest thing about medical matters, he would know that one should never undermine a patient's confidence in his doctor, particularly not during a complicated operation. He should stick to military matters only. If you would be kind enough to dismiss him from this shield wall, you would be doing all of us a great service.
; str_npc13_personalityclash2_speech_b|He keeps saying that I'd better watch my back, for someday he will stick his spear deep into my dark Svia heart. He has sworn to kill me in the next battle. You had better keep a close eye on this fool.
; str_npc14_personalityclash2_speech_b|In our last battle, while I was singing about the many battles that your leadership, alongside my courage, allowed us to turn into victories, he spat on the ground and told me to keep my 'arrogant yapper' shut. If this man does not understand the legendary nature of our feats, then he should not be allowed to share our future glory and fortune.
; str_npc15_personalityclash2_speech_b|{s11} responded that Hippocrates was an 'antiquated know-nothing,' incomparable to the knowledgeable Galenus. Strategos, no true medic would have such disrespect for the great masters of the past. I do not believe you should employ such an obvious impostor.
; str_npc16_personalityclash2_speech_b|This awful woman has openly declared that she follows the pagan gods Odin and Thor, and that the teachings of Christ are nothing more than the babblings of weak men. She even made an absurd remark suggesting that I, a holy priest, brought us all bad luck with my 'gibberish preaching.' If you have no intention of leading all of your men to Hell, this Norse woman should be immediately sent to her afterlife by fire.
; str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech|Warlord, {s11} didn't do badly in that last fight at all. He's a good egg, that one.
; str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech|{reg59?Madame:Sir}, I just wanted to tell you that {s11} may be a rough sort, and I'll venture a complete drunkard as well, but I'm proud to call him my companion.
; str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech|Hello, {reg59?madame:sir}! I had just wanted to tell you that {s11} is a most gallant and brave warrior. Did you see him in our last battle?
; str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech|I just wanted to say a word in praise of {s11}. He did well in that last battle.
; str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech|That was a fine battle, {playername}! {s11} is a good companion to have by our side in a fight.
; str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech|Sometimes I am troubled by all this bloodshed, but I know that proud warlords must be humbled and cruel bandits tamed if we are to restore peace.
; str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech|Warlord, I was just talking to {s11}. He might be an outspoken man, but he holds no prejudice for me being a woman or a Pict.
; str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech|A fine battle that was, warlord. I have to say, I greatly enjoy the company of {s11}, for he is a fine commander of men.
; str_npc9_personalitymatch_speech|Warlord, {s11} acquitted herself well in that fight back there. A fine, modest maiden she is, if I dare say so myself.
; str_npc10_personalitymatch_speech|Dryhten! I wish you joy in your victory! Say, I really like the company of that Solveig. I see that she is extremely devoted to the safety of our shield wall.
; str_npc11_personalitymatch_speech|Oh {reg59?my pretty:handsome}, I could not praise you more for having women of such quality as {s11} within our shield wall. I do not care that she is a Frisian, supposedly weak and once a slave to the Danish.
; str_npc12_personalitymatch_speech|A bloody business, warlord, a bloody business -- although a necessary one, of course. {s11}, I believe, shares my ambivalence about this constant fighting, at least against non-Visigoths, as he always insists on saying.
; str_npc13_personalitymatch_speech|It is a pleasure going into battle with a fine Frisian noble like {s11} by my side.
; str_npc14_personalitymatch_speech|You have earned your name today, oh valorous one! And {s11}, too! I like that one. He knows the great poems and plays of the ancient Greeks, which appeals to an artistic soul like my own.
; str_npc15_personalitymatch_speech|Strategos. I was just having a word with {s11} after our last battle, and it strikes me that the man has a good head on his shoulders.
; str_npc16_personalitymatch_speech|I must tell you that, even though {s11} behaves in a rough, unmannered way, I can see that, in his heart, he has, maybe unknown to himself, a good Christian soul.
; str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech_b|{s11} is awesome! He is always joking, proud and brave, and knows how to seduce girls, I'll warrant. I'm glad to have him with us.
; str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech_b|Based on how he did in that last fight, I'd say that I'd trust my back to him any day. He also knows how to share tales and legends by the camp fire after a fine battle. I already promised to take him to a Nordic mead hall someday.
; str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech_b|I also confess that I find him a truly delightful companion, a man of both wit and manners. Perhaps, perhaps... Ah, but I say too much. Good day, {reg59?madame:sir}.
; str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech_b|You chose well to enlist him in our shield wall. He knows a thing or two about a fight.
; str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech_b|It is clear from his battle prowess that he is a true descendant of a brave warrior. He honors, in the battlefield, the greatness of his lineage.
; str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech_b|I must say that {s11} is a source of great comfort to me. I told him of my sin, and he said to me that Christ would forgive my transgression, if I repent and truly desire such forgiveness. He is wise, and I am glad that he is with us.
; str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech_b|He preaches to me just like to anyone else, and told me that even if my body is covered by war tattoos, God can still see the good intentions within my heart. I am not sure I completely liked what he said, for I am a warrior, not a simple housemaid, but, still, I feel I can trust that priest and his teachings.
; str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech_b|We are both veterans, and, as such, can both easily perceive the many tactical flaws the warriors of this land commit during battle. Our shield wall is much stronger with him in it.
; str_npc9_personalitymatch_speech_b|Were she not a mere slave, I might ask for her hand. It is a pity that she is not a free, pure woman, but speaking with her is a pleasant way to pass time on the march.
; str_npc10_personalitymatch_speech_b|Actually, I see that she is extremely devoted to you. Please, Dryhten, don't let it embarrass you! A devoted woman like that can be more valuable than a hundred warriors.
; str_npc11_personalitymatch_speech_b|She is clearly a survivor that has profound respect and obedience to you. This, of course, makes me extremely happy. If only all of our people were like her, someone who has overcome a troubled past in the house of the jarl of Kennemer. Those experiences, the difficult ones, are those that bring out the best in people, don't you think?
; str_npc12_personalitymatch_speech_b|It saddens him deeply to take the lives of his fellow men, however just the cause. He and I have talked together of a brighter future, of the need to unite these petty warring kingdoms of Englaland, so that we may bring this time of troubles to an end.
; str_npc13_personalitymatch_speech_b|He has a warrior's heart, even though it requires much more to learn the art of war. Though he may not be as fast on his feet as some, he knows the wisdom of holding together in a disciplined battle-line. You showed good sense in bringing him into this shield wall.
; str_npc14_personalitymatch_speech_b|The tales from his homeland that he likes to recite by the campfire also teach a lot about battles and warfare in general. I especially enjoy the heroic deeds that happened during the war with Troy. Soon, our shield wall will be a legend as glorious and famous as the heroes of Agamemnon's time.
; str_npc15_personalitymatch_speech_b|Even though he seems to be nothing more than a proud leader of men, he understands that war, like any other affair, requires careful planning and preparation and a firm grasp of strategic principals. A fine proof of that is how interested he got in the military aspects of the siege of Troy, as I was telling him that tale the other day.
; str_npc16_personalitymatch_speech_b|{s11} is an intelligent man with great wisdom. I like to listen to him at the camp fire, and he listens to me when I speak of Christ. The truth is that we have very interesting discussions. You should join us someday.
; str_npc1_retirement_speech|I'm a bit tired of marching up and down the land, shedding my blood for someone else's cause. The loot is good, but I think I've got enough of that, now. I'm going to head back to my father's cave, near Hadrian's Wall. Sorry, but this life of adventure and danger is over for me.
; str_npc2_retirement_speech|I'm getting a bit tired of the warrior's life. I'm going to invest my share of our loot in mead and women. I would like to thank you again for taking me on, and wish you the best of luck.
; str_npc3_retirement_speech|I am afraid I have something to tell you. I have decided that the warrior's life, even if better than a slave's one, is not for me. One final time, I thank you for freeing me, but it is time for me to find myself a more peaceful way of life. I think I have enough money to return to my father, Thonkrik, to start a new life as a merchant. I hope you will not be angry, {reg59?madame:sir}.
; str_npc4_retirement_speech|I have fought with you honorably, but I am not altogether satisfied with your leadership. Farewell.
; str_npc5_retirement_speech|{reg59?Madame:Sir}, since I joined your shield wall, I have fought for you fiercely and loyally, but you have not rewarded my service with the kind of leadership position that I deserve. So I will hope that my exile sentence has somehow been revoked and go home.
; str_npc6_retirement_speech|I joined this shield wall in the hope that you would lead me out of darkness, and indeed, I have found a measure of peace here, but I have some qualms about your leadership. Mostly, I have begun to suspect that my path to redemption can be found elsewhere.
; str_npc7_retirement_speech|I am tired of this squalid life of endless warfare, seeing weak men debased by fear, greed, lust, and a hundred other faults. I have money in my purse. I am going north, back to Alban, to assemble my own raiding party of Scots and Picts. I shall give rest to neither Briton nor Saxon, but you shall still have my peace.
; str_npc8_retirement_speech|I have fought in your shield wall and done well by it, but your decisions are not always to my liking. Anyway, I have another task. I will take what plunder I have won and raise a shield wall of my own. Then I will sail to Friese, where I shall recover my land. I wish you well.
; str_npc9_retirement_speech|We have fought well together and earned much glory, but I have some reservations about your leadership. At any rate, I have to kill that witch-snake spouse of my father. I will be leaving you. Perhaps we will meet again.
; str_npc10_retirement_speech|I've had enough of tramping up and down the length and breadth of these lands. I've earned enough to buy a small bit of land somewhere far from the hateful Welsh, so I think I'll give that a try. So long, and best of luck to you.
; str_npc11_retirement_speech|You have been very kind to me this whole time, but I... I am unable to endure the pain of {reg59?envy:love}. I beg your pardon, but I can no longer have you in my sight, since I know I forever can be nothing more than a lesser light before you. {reg59?:Moreover, as I am a skjaldmo, I have to preserve my virginity. }So I'll be off, although I don't know to where. Farewell, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}.
; str_npc12_retirement_speech|I've done all right in your shield wall. I've filled my belly, put some silver in my purse, and broadened my knowledge of wounds and injury. I can't complain about that, but I think right now that service in this shield wall is holding me back. I have a duty to share my findings with other doctors, and for that, I need to hire scribes that have an excellent understanding of Latin. These are rare in Englaland, so I will be going to Rome.
; str_npc13_retirement_speech|I would like to inform you that I wish to sever our relationship. I intend to seek alternative employment; perhaps join my fate to that of the Rus.
; str_npc14_retirement_speech|As the lustre of your name grows ever brighter, I fear that my own reputation will pale in comparison, as the moon is outshone by the sun. I have decided to strike out on my own. The very best of luck to you!
; str_npc15_retirement_speech|I appreciate that you took me on, but I'm not altogether happy about how things have worked out. I'm going to head off elsewhere -- maybe go home to Konstantinoupolis, maybe find another job. I haven't quite decided yet.
; str_npc16_retirement_speech|You and your men are a lost cause to the faith. I see that your souls are already taken by the Devil, since many of you uphold the ways of the old false pagan gods. Even my word was unable to change you and your evil ways, so I can only hope that God will have mercy upon you despite your terrible sins. I leave now.
; str_npc1_rehire_speech|Warlord, it's good to see you again. I know we had our differences, but now I recognize that those were some of the best days I've known. And, to tell you the truth, I've had a bit of difficulty finding work. Listen, if you're willing to have me back, I'd be willing to sign up with your shield wall again.
; str_npc2_rehire_speech|{reg59?Madame:Sir}! It's good to see you again! Actually, I confess, I've been looking for you. I spent all my money and need more. I guess I'm just destined to fight for a living. People tell me that you, on the other hand, have done very well for yourself. So tell me, {reg59?madame:sir}, will you have me back?
; str_npc3_rehire_speech|Well, hello {reg59?madame:sir}! It is very good to see you again. I have not fared so well since we parted, I am afraid. My savings from the time we travelled together, which I hoped would give me a start in trading, have not been enough to start a decent business. And, I must say, I fear being turned again into a slave. Perhaps I am better suited to war than to commerce, to share a meal over a campfire with rough fellows than to drink mead. {reg59?Madame:Sir}, I must ask you -- will you take me back?
; str_npc4_rehire_speech|It's been a while. You've done well for yourself, I hear. I know there's been some bad blood between us, but I'd be honored to fight in your ranks once again.
; str_npc5_rehire_speech|{playername}! Your fame grows ever greater -- even as far as my homeland, beyond the mountains. I'd returned there, hoping that my exile would have been forgotten. Well, it hadn't. Even before I set foot in my valley, I received word from my family that there were warriors looking for me in case I crossed the kingdom's border. So I've returned, hoping you might forget any harsh words I may have spoken, to see if I could fight with you once again.
; str_npc6_rehire_speech|It is good to see you, {playername}. Everywhere I go, men are in awe of your deeds. I have not had it so well since I left. Wherever I go, I feel my former demons returning. My soul is in turmoil. For reasons that I cannot fully explain, I had found peace in your company. Will you allow me to serve with you once again?
; str_npc7_rehire_speech|Warlord! It is good to see you. Unfortunately, even with all the money I saved from my share of the loot, the absurd taunt of being a traitor and a woman was still directed at me. No Pictish warrior would consider joining a war band lead by me. Dammit, that's just the way life goes, I guess. Will you have me back?
; str_npc8_rehire_speech|Greetings to you, {playername}. I was wondering if the harsh words between us in the past could be forgotten. I could not find thirty men to crew a ship, and those whom I gathered quickly got bored and wandered off -- not, I will add, before they drank away such silver as I had accumulated. Then I thought back to the battles we fought together. Those were good days, and profitable ones, too.
; str_npc9_rehire_speech|My dear, dear {reg59?lady:man}! It is so good to see you! I sought service with the lords of this land, but was grievously disappointed. Half of them ask me to carry gifts to fellow lords, as if I were a simple errand boy, or to beat down lazy peasants, as if I were a farm overseer. One even asked me to murder one of his rivals! Those are no kind of activities for a brave warrior like me! So I have been seeking you, to see if you might wish me to join you again.
; str_npc10_rehire_speech|Dryhten! It's good to see you again! It turns out I'm not much of a farmer. Too soft on the hired hands, I figure. I let them rob me blind. I guess fighting is what I know best, even if accompanied by Britons and Mercians. So tell me, Dryhten, are you still looking for good men?
; str_npc11_rehire_speech|{reg59?My pretty:Handsome}, I've thought a lot since we parted. Now I know in my heart that, even if sometimes we cannot get what we most desire, it is better to live close by than far away from it. Perhaps there is hope left, after all, that your company will be good for me. So, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}, will you take me back?
; str_npc12_rehire_speech|Warlord! It's a fine thing to see an honest face like yours, for this world is so full of lies! I went Rome to publish my findings, hired some scribes and made a handful of codices. Then I waited for the commissions, but it turns out that the philosophers don't care about real medical knowledge and instead prefer to discuss quasi-magical theories. I'll keep trying, but first need to replenish the money in my bag. Are you looking for a physician?
; str_npc13_rehire_speech|It is so good to see you. When last we parted, I practically swore that I would not serve you again. Perhaps I judged you too harshly. I have tried serving in other jarls' armies. Believe me; what I have seen of them restores my opinion of your leadership. If you will have me in your shield wall, I will fight for you again.
; str_npc14_rehire_speech|Well, hello there, valorous one! I have been hoping to see you again. Everywhere I go, I hear tales and songs of your deeds. I admit that I felt a twinge of regret that we had parted ways and, I'll confess it, a twinge of jealousy as well. I thought that I might once more fight by your side and thus bask in the reflection of your glory. Perhaps we might ride together again for a little while.
; str_npc15_rehire_speech|Why hello, strategos! I can't say I'm displeased to see you again. You see, I could not find a ship to take me to the continent, and so I took on another contract before I left, and, sure enough, when it came time to collect the pay, the lord had nothing but talk and excuses and petty little complaints about my handiwork. I can't say I was always happy in your shield wall, but at least you put silver directly into my purse after every battle. Are you still offering work?
; str_npc16_rehire_speech|I am here to offer another chance to you and your men. An angel came to me in a dream, and told me the future of your immortal soul. The angel said that your only chance of eventually going to Heaven lies entirely upon my work as a preacher. You are my responsibility. So, I beg you to accept me again in your shield wall. Maybe this time you will pay heed to the word of God.
; str_npc1_home_intro|Warlord, perhaps you didn't know this about Hadrian's Wall. Near here is a cave where I was born eighteen years ago. This is a special place that we should stop and visit, for it has long history. Romans, those legendary warriors, dwelt here.
; str_npc2_home_intro|Ribe! That's where I was born twenty years ago. Son of a king and yet a slave, but the best skald in all Danmark.
; str_npc3_home_intro|Can you smell that? It is the smell of evil. It is the smell of Kennemer. How I hate that place! I spent the worst years of my life there. Just being around this site makes me nauseous.
; str_npc4_home_intro|Perhaps you didn't know about Dun Onlaigh, a magnificent Dal Riata fortress.
; str_npc5_home_intro|Oh, perhaps you didn't know this about Din Tagell, one of the mightiest forts of Cornubia. I served in the shield wall of its lord, as a dryhten, long before I was forced into exile.
; str_npc6_home_intro|Perhaps you don't know about Cantwareburh, in the kingdom of West Seaxe. This is the city where the ship, the Woden Ric, should have brought me, but the Viking attack near the coast of Friese changed all that. Changed my fate forever.
; str_npc7_home_intro|Pay attention, and be careful. We are now in Alban, near Dun Taruo. The kingdom of Alban is the most powerful in the north.
; str_npc8_home_intro|We are in the kingdom of Friese, where Dorestad is the main town. Years ago, we Frisians were subjects of the Franks, but later, a Dane became king. Well, really, Frisians do not recognize these kings, but have to accept their power. We prefer to live.
; str_npc9_home_intro|Behold the horizon, for there lies the fortress of Rendlaesham, seat of power of the kings of East Engle.
; str_npc10_home_intro|Look, the trading town of Lundenwic, home to the Saxons of East Seaxna. This beautiful site has a glorious past and, I might bet, a bright future.
; str_npc11_home_intro|That smell is of salt and the sweat of the people that work the sea. It is the warmth of home... Tunsberg.
; str_npc12_home_intro|Perhaps you don't know about Heidabyr, if that interests you.
; str_npc13_home_intro|East, past the land of the Norwegians, are my people, the Sviar, a warlike and strong people. Our destiny is to rule others.
; str_npc14_home_intro|Ah, Caiseal! Such a lovely spot, at the foot of the Eriu. The region of Mhumhain, or Munster, is certainly the most poetic and beautiful part of what Romans called Hibernia.
; str_npc15_home_intro|Do you see that small settlement over there? It is Hordaland.
; str_npc16_home_intro|Oh my God! That is Witan Ceaster. I lived near here, in a village. My parents, travelers, could not take care of me and gave me to the monks of Witan Ceaster.
; str_npc1_home_description|My name, Caio, has passed from generation to generation. The first who had it was an ancestor of mine, descended from a man named Virio, who was the grandson of a man who had served defending the wall.
; str_npc2_home_description|People say that the Danish are a bunch of bloodthirsty men, but they have a good head for trade, if you ask me. People up and down the coast produce pottery, textiles and leather. Ribe is also famous for its women, if you understand what I mean.
; str_npc3_home_description|Kennemer is a Danish fort now, but it was not always so. In fact, before the Danish, the Franks ruled from there. We Frisians did not like the Franks as much. They imposed their religion, Christianity, and their lords are very controlling. So when the Danish first came, we did not mind. These masters are a little more indulgent, allowing use more freedom as long as we pay tribute.
; str_npc4_home_description|You know I do not talk much, but I would say that I am proud to be a Scot of the Dal Riata. You've heard many stories about the Scots, or maybe none. People thought we were just pirates who looted the coast, and cursed us for it. Then came the Norwegians, who are worse.
; str_npc5_home_description|Cornubia used to be a strong kingdom called Dumnonia. People from Dumnonia usually call themselves 'Defnas,' which simply means 'men of Dumnonia.' Our land was famous for the high quality of tin extracted from its many mines. Now our kingdom is small and poor.
; str_npc6_home_description|You know that Cantwareburh was the capital of the kingdom of Cent until very recently. I read about this before I came here, and I talked to a Saxon scholar who had been invited to Asturias. In my kingdom, we call everybody here 'Saxons,' but, really, in Cent lived Jutes, people who preceded the Saxons from across the sea.
; str_npc7_home_description|The Kingdom of Alban is simply a merger of two people: the Dal Riata, people who migrated generations ago from Hibernia, and us Picts. Our nobles and kings have become so mixed that we are now one kingdom. The common people have their differences yet, for there are many years of war between us.
; str_npc8_home_description|Frisians are a reserved people. They like to be left alone to their affairs, and the Danish are better lords than the Franks. As long as we pay taxes and accept their authority, they leave us alone.
; str_npc9_home_description|The kings of East Engle are from the Wuffing dynasty, descended from the legendary king Wuffa. Their origins lie with the Geats, as in the tale of Beowulf. They were the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms back in the day, but not any more. Now they are just servants of the Danish.
; str_npc10_home_description|Here once stood Londinium, the Roman capital of Britannia. Lundenwic lies very close to the ruins of Londinium, of which now remains a fort usually called Lundenburh. Its name means 'trading town of Londinium,' or simply, as we Saxons say, 'London.'
; str_npc11_home_description|I'm from here, you know. I think I have managed to become such a fine warrior by your side because war runs thick in the blood of every man and woman of Northvegr. These are times of war in this land. The jarls fight each other constantly.
; str_npc12_home_description|Heidabyr is not the oldest site in Danmark, but it is becoming important. Actually, it was founded a few generations ago by Rerik merchants. The fled here when their city was destroyed by King Gotrik.
; str_npc13_home_description|While the Danes and Norwegians focus on the west, the Svia look east to the land of the Slavs and beyond, even to the rich trading city of Mikligard.
; str_npc14_home_description|This is the home of the best bards from these lands. Even small boys and girls from this kingdom sing better than the bards from the rest of world. Many of the people also respect the old traditions and gods, and thus Munster is the most prosperous land in all of Eriu.
; str_npc15_home_description|Hordaland is one of the small kingdoms in Northvegr. It is led by Eirik Konungr, who was my master. I know him well. He's a tough man, violent and loving nothing more than the independence of his kingdom. So he doesn't like the vow of Harald Tanglehair to unify Northvegr under one king.
; str_npc16_home_description|Witan Ceaster is the capital of the Saxons of West Seaxe. West Seaxe is now the most powerful kingdom in Britannia or Englaland, as our land is called. With Mierce weakened, West Seaxe is the only kingdom that can stop the Danish.
; str_npc1_home_description_2|Since then, it has passed from father to son. My father, the old Roman that you met, is called Caio. The name will not be lost, for all my brothers are also called Caio. My mother called us Caio Maior, Caio Secundo, and Caio Minor in order to distinguish us.
; str_npc2_home_description_2|Someday I'll buy a farm near Ribe. I will marry two or three women and dedicate myself to making children. Or maybe not. I may soon get bored of it...
; str_npc3_home_description_2|But now it seems that the Danish may be worse, in fact, than the Franks. Many Frisians have rebelled against their dominion. The Danish are people who take what they want, regardless of who is harmed, and they value their strength above our laws. I hate them! They made me a slave!
; str_npc4_home_description_2|The truth is that, for many Gaels, to become Scots was a way out of poverty, especially in such a closed society like Eriu. We joined a brotherhood and threw ourselves to the dangers of the sea. Looting and robbery were our ways. It was not very different from what others are doing today, but we were never as bloody as the Norwegians.
; str_npc5_home_description_2|We only have the memories and history. Do you know that Din Tagell was the place where they say the man, Arthur, whom the bards sing about, was born?
; str_npc6_home_description_2|The Jutes conquered this land from the Britons after Rome left Britannia. Curiously, the Danish, who are the Jutes' relatives, or perhaps their descendants, are now their enemies and attack this land. I remember long afternoons with the Saxon scholar, an old man named Bedda, who informed me of this part of the world and prepared me for my trip.
; str_npc7_home_description_2|The Picts are fine shepherds and hunters, but these Dal Riata are a clan of pirates, Scots. But I should not say that, since we are now fighting on the same side and for the king himself.
; str_npc8_home_description_2|Many of us prefer our own government, without the interference from either the Franks or Danish, but this is impossible as long as we are divided and unable to raise an army. Our aethelings, our noblemen, prefer to serve the Danish. Without an aetheling to lead us, the frilings, the freemen, are unable to organize. Perhaps our fate is to be dominated by other people forever.
; str_npc9_home_description_2|They harbor a great hatred against the rival kingdoms. Curiously enough, their territory is one of the few parts of Britannia where rainfall is sparse and the climate is dry. I am not really sure if you will ever want to fight their warriors for such a piece of land. I don't think it'd be worth it.
; str_npc10_home_description_2|The mouth of the river Fleet serves Lundenwic as a harbour for both trade and fishing. Merchants from all the nations of Europe are slowly flocking to Lundenwic in search of good commercial opportunities. And here, the old gods are still very well respected, but I should not say any more about that...
; str_npc11_home_description_2|A young lord from Tunsberg, Harald Tanglehair, intends to rule over all Northvegr. He is smart and ruthless -- like you, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}! Then, he says, he will finally comb his head and marry Gyda Eiriksdottir, but of course he'd have to kill her father first. Anyway, Tunsberg is an important center of commerce, and I'm sure you'll find many trade goods and news from all over the world. Shall we go?
; str_npc12_home_description_2|I am sure that King Gotrik's name sounds familiar to you, no? He was a famous man because, fearing an invasion of the Franks from the south, he built an enormous structure to defend Danmark. We called it the Danavirki. It is an important linear defensive earthwork constructed across the neck of the Danmark peninsula.
; str_npc13_home_description_2|Anyway, I will not bore you with long talks. We could talk until the time that Midgardr ends and Ragnarok comes, ha!
; str_npc14_home_description_2|Their nobility, of which I am also part, I must admit, is also the noblest of the nobilities. This is because all of us have at least one drop of the blood of the nine goddesses that bless our homeland within us. These goddesses are: Anann, Aine, Grian, Cliodhna, Aimend, Mor Muman, Bebinn, Aibell, and the infamous, but extremely beautiful Queen Mongfind. Settle here, oh valorous one, and someday one of those goddesses might come to your bed in the dark of the night, just as Mongfind came to me twelve winters ago.
; str_npc15_home_description_2|Eirik is the father of Gyda, the beautiful girl who put the thought of unifying Northvegr in Harald's head. Now the silly boy will not allow comb to touch his head until he wins her hand. She's a regular Helen of Troy. Perhaps you should go there to see her for yourself.
; str_npc16_home_description_2|I grew up in Witan Ceaster, played in its muddy streets when not forced to study, and I loved running around the stalls when we went to the market. Witan Ceaster was an important town in Roman times, I read, but it was almost abandoned later until King Cenwalh built its first church. He was also the king who brought Christianity to West Seaxe, for which he repudiated his first wife, the sister of pagan King Penda of Mierce.
; str_npc1_home_recap|I'm from near Hadrian's Wall, where I lived in a cave.
; str_npc2_home_recap|I was born in Ribe, in Danmark. I'm a warrior, the son of a king and a slave.
; str_npc3_home_recap|I used to live as a slave in {s20}, but I spent my childhood in Doccinga, where I was really happy. I just hope my father, Thonkrik, does not think badly of me, as I have had to live as a slave... They would have killed me if I had not obeyed the jarl's orders. A parent should never know how low his children have fallen.
; str_npc4_home_recap|I am a Scot and a Dal Riata.
; str_npc5_home_recap|I was born in Cornubia, but have been forever exiled from my homeland. Only with your shield wall am I allowed to travel there -- without, that is, using a disguise.
; str_npc6_home_recap|I am from Cantabria, in the Kingdom of Asturias, as you know. It is in the north of Hispania. We are warlike people who, when not killing Muslims, are dedicated to killing each other, supporting one king or another. Our current king is Aldefonsus, son of Ordonius. Ordonius was a good king, but he died recently. I hope his son is a worthy successor.
; str_npc7_home_recap|I was born in Dun Taruo, in the Kingdom of Alban.
; str_npc8_home_recap|I was born in Friese and never thought I would leave it. My father was a friling, a free man with a plot of land. I inherited the land but sold it when my family all died. Now I have nothing but the strength of my hands.
; str_npc9_home_recap|I am from the continent, and my people call themselves Franks.
; str_npc10_home_recap|I am a Saxon, not an Angle, from Lundenwic.
; str_npc11_home_recap|Why, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}? I am from Tunsberg, in Northvegr.
; str_npc12_home_recap|I am the younger son of a hersir in Odinsve. I traveled to Frankia and Rome in search of medical lore.
; str_npc13_home_recap|I am a Svia. My people are destined to reign over all the east. The Danish will be destroyed quickly if their kings still covet our land.
; str_npc14_home_recap|Oh, from the most magnificent region of Mhumhain, in the southern part of Hibernia, land of bards and goddesses.
; str_npc15_home_recap|I come from Konstantinoupolis, the most beautiful and largest city in the world. The largest towns here are but small villages compared to Konstantinoupolis. Heck, one could practically fit in the Hagia Sofia, the main church there. You should travel there someday.
; str_npc16_home_recap|I lived in Witan Ceaster for many years. That city brings back great memories, but I know my place is not there.

; str_npc1_kingsupport_1|That's a great idea, Warlord. All these men and landed nobles who rule now, with their prisons and gibbets and scaffolds, whip, brand or hang any man who might be driven by the crying of his children to steal a loaf of bread, or maybe a horse. This land deserves something better.
; str_npc2_kingsupport_1|Well, warlord, I'd support you. I think you'd give this world the kind of enlightened rule that it has long needed.
; str_npc3_kingsupport_1|Well, my {reg59?lady:lord}, I would worry for you. Our histories tell us that power tends to corrupt, but in the end, I am comforted by the mercy and judgment you have shown as lord of this shield wall.
; str_npc4_kingsupport_1|I think that you would be the kind of {reg59?queen:king} that well-born warriors such as I would be proud to follow into battle.
; str_npc5_kingsupport_1|A fine idea! You have shown that you know how to govern men. Mind that you govern them justly, though...
; str_npc6_kingsupport_1|I cannot judge the legal merits of your claim. However, I think that, unlike the other kings here, you have the capacity to unify this land. That would put a stop to these endless wars between kingdom and kingdom, noble and noble, and brother and brother, that have brought us all into disgrace in the eyes of the gods.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_1|Aye, you'll do well. You know how to treat trackers, Picts, and women.
; str_npc8_kingsupport_1|The Saga of Beowulf tells us that a man who does deeds greater than those of the other men of his time may claim a throne for himself. I'd say that you could make that claim.
; str_npc9_kingsupport_1|Very good, Dryhten. I'm a Frank by blood, but Dagobert didn't support me when I was cheated of my inheritance. So I don't owe him anything, and I would be more than happy to have you as my {reg59?queen:king}.
; str_npc10_kingsupport_1|Well, warlord, I suppose Englaland really needs a powerful king. The Welsh and Angles are but weaklings and idiots, while the Saxons, incomprehensibly, can't seem to unite to conquer the whole land.
; str_npc11_kingsupport_1|Why, that's a fine idea, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}! I suppose I shall have to learn to call you 'King' or 'Konungr,' then... Which I'd be more than happy to do if you called me 'Royal {reg59?Companion:Consort}.'
; str_npc12_kingsupport_1|I am sure that you would make a fine king, warlord. I flatter myself that I am a good judge of character, and you have demonstrated a capacity for compassion that far exceeds that of these others who call themselves monarchs.
; str_npc13_kingsupport_1|Well, {reg59?madame:sir}, the heavens have instituted a hierarchy in this world. Normally, I would have no truck with usurpation, but I also think that the kings of this land are a weak and sorry lot, not worthy the name of king. Circumstance leaves the crown free to be taken by a better ruler, such as you.
; str_npc14_kingsupport_1|That would be a fine thing, {reg59?my lady:sir}! Many are the tales of kings that proved their worthiness to wear a crown through valor and courage. Perhaps you know the tale of Cu Chulainn, whose bravery and feats of arms are unparalleled in Hibernia and Britannia. A splendid tale!
; str_npc15_kingsupport_1|Well, you pay your men on time, when you can, generally speaking. That's the best qualification for kingship there is, in my book. You also show some respect for the rights of others.
; str_npc16_kingsupport_1|It seems to me that you hear my words and that your soul stirs before Christ's teachings. Yes, I am sure that God not only approves but is planning your ascension as a rightful king over the sinful people of these lands.
; str_npc1_kingsupport_2|Sure would, warlord, but let me tell you what might bring others to your cause -- particularly us poor folk. They tell us that in the old days, the great Roman lords -- they were called governors, or maybe senators, I can't remember -- would, upon ascending to power, issue amnesty for all but the worst prisoners in the land's dungeons, giving people a second chance to make something of themselves.
; str_npc2_kingsupport_2|Most of the lords of this land, well, let's just say that they never held a pening that they didn't keep as rent or loot. You, on the other hand, have some experience of commerce and trade, due to acting as warlord and managing your domains. If you like, warlord, I reckon I could find some support for you among the men of this realm.
; str_npc3_kingsupport_2|I would, my {reg59?lady:lord}, but I would ask you to establish at least a minimal amount of rights for slaves. They need to be protected from further abuse. You know I was a slave, and we are the most abused people in the land. Slaves really need to be protected by a rightful and fair ruler.
; str_npc4_kingsupport_2|Of course, warlord. The trick is now to get others to follow you. As you know, one's lineage is a great determinant of one's worthiness. Perhaps you have a long-lost ancestor of whom you have not told me...
; str_npc5_kingsupport_2|I would, but there is something I should say on behalf of men that have been wronged like I have. There must be a way for feuding nobles to have their disputes resolved without bloodshed. I lost everything I cherished in life because the only honorable option my king had left me was to murder my enemies. There should be some kind of law, some kind of... common law, to settle this kind of feud, or, maybe, any kind of dispute. That law would be based on the uses and customs of the land.
; str_npc6_kingsupport_2|I would. I would tell anyone who listens of your deeds on behalf of the weak and helpless and of your ability to lead men against great odds and triumph. I would tell them that, if you were to become {reg59?queen:king}, there would be one law and one peace -- from the Pictish highlands to the Goidelic woods, from the lowlands to the southern shore. But you must have the goal to go further and reunite what was once a glorious empire, to rival that of Rome.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_2|Yes, warlord, I would. A {reg59?queen:king}'s duty is to adequately respect all men and women that serve under {reg59?her:his} banner. You have proven more than able to do this, for, to you, the hunter and the tracker, the woman and the Pict, are as important as the warrior and the soldier, as the man and the Briton.
; str_npc8_kingsupport_2|I would -- on one condition. You'd be king wherever you want to rule, but after you are installed in your hall and your rule is unchallenged throughout the land, you will help me to free Friese.
; str_npc9_kingsupport_2|I would, warlord, and others would, too. But here's what I think -- you need to show the noble lords that you'll uphold their ancient rights. Right now, these lands are a mess. A lord owns the land, except it's the king who owns the forest, but the city has the right to levy tax at its gates, yet any commoner can use the pastures on odd Tuesdays, except in Pictland, where there is not so much as a notion of order at all. So I say you make things simple, like it was in the old days before even the Romans conquered Britannia. First the {reg59?sovereign:king}, then the lords, then everyone else.
; str_npc10_kingsupport_2|Certainly, dryhten, but I'd ask that you consider an idea of mine. If you became {reg59?queen:king}, then I'd ask you to open your court to Saxon nobility only. The others are weak, fragile and cowardly, and their only place in your kingdom should be as peasants, servants or slaves.
; str_npc11_kingsupport_2|Of course I would! I am sure, by the way you act, command and fight, also by the way you walk, and speak and love... that you are the only person worthy enough to become Brytenwalda.
; str_npc12_kingsupport_2|Of course, warlord, but if I have learned anything in my travels in this land, it is that Vikings, Saxons, Franks, and all else are sticklers for tradition. These traditions vary from one to the other, but they all remember something of the old Roman Empire, especially the Franks, who are said to be its heirs.
; str_npc13_kingsupport_2|I would indeed, {reg59?madame:sir}. I think you can unite this land, and then we'll be able to raise an army such as Englaland has never seen -- Saxons, Angles, Picts, Norse, Goidels and even Britons, all together in one strong and invincible shield wall. We will travel to the continent in strong sea vessels to subdue all the lands of the Franks!
; str_npc14_kingsupport_2|Of course, my {reg59?lady:lord}. Also, when claiming a throne, it does not hurt to be the subject of an epic poem, recited around camp and hearth fires, describing one's heroic deeds. As you no doubt know, I fancy myself a fair crafter of couplets. You could be as famous as Cu Chulainn, if only you let me sing of your deeds.
; str_npc15_kingsupport_2|I would. People might say that perhaps you don't have royal blood in your veins, but from what I've seen, royal blood makes one essentially a beggar. Kings and nobles take out loans or commission building projects without half a thought to how they're ever going to pay back all those commoners who expect little more than to eat after an honest day's work. If you ask me, an honest tongue makes a {reg59?woman:man} a {reg59?queen:king}, not a fancy pedigree.
; str_npc16_kingsupport_2|Of course! I know that you plan to search out and burn any remnant of heresy and paganism in these lands. I know that you will only rest when there is no trace of the Devil in the hearts of your subjects, when every man, woman and child will have only the Holy Bible as their guide, as properly interpreted by a priest. Is your soul so pure as to do as I say?
; str_npc1_kingsupport_2a|Please go on...
; str_npc2_kingsupport_2a|Please continue...
; str_npc3_kingsupport_2a|I'm interested in hearing it...
; str_npc4_kingsupport_2a|Of course! Let me tell you all about him...
; str_npc5_kingsupport_2a|Please go on...
; str_npc6_kingsupport_2a|Splendid! That was exactly what I was thinking.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_2a|Well, yes, I try to be fair to everyone...
; str_npc8_kingsupport_2a|Fair enough.
; str_npc9_kingsupport_2a|That seems sensible enough...
; str_npc10_kingsupport_2a|Of course! Everyone knows only Saxons are fit to be nobles.
; str_npc11_kingsupport_2a|Tell me more.
; str_npc12_kingsupport_2a|Interesting. Please go on...
; str_npc13_kingsupport_2a|Please go on...
; str_npc14_kingsupport_2a|Very good, captain.
; str_npc15_kingsupport_2a|Well spoken, Strategos!
; str_npc16_kingsupport_2a|Of course I am. We are nothing but instruments of God.
str_npc1_kingsupport_2b|Zapomnij.
; str_npc2_kingsupport_2b|I do not ask for their support, as they would no doubt wish to make a profit on the transaction.
; str_npc3_kingsupport_2b|I have no intention of helping any more slaves, sorry.
; str_npc4_kingsupport_2b|I don't have any, unfortunately.
; str_npc5_kingsupport_2b|No, I believe the lords should resolve their disputes by blood, and blood only. Laws are only useful to the weak.
; str_npc6_kingsupport_2b|I am sorry, but my future kingdom will not meddle with continental affairs.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_2b|Sorry. I respect you for your abilities, but warriors, men, and Britons are much more deserving than others.
; str_npc8_kingsupport_2b|That's a pretty tall condition. By the time I am {reg59?queen:king}, Friese will probably have freed itself from the Danish.
; str_npc9_kingsupport_2b|I'm not sure that implementing your idea would be as 'simple' as you think
; str_npc10_kingsupport_2b|You are out of your mind. There are valorous and noble men from every nation.
; str_npc11_kingsupport_2b|I do not want to be a Brytenwalda. Forget it.
; str_npc12_kingsupport_2b|Enough, sir. I will not have you mock our traditions.
; str_npc13_kingsupport_2b|Actually, I was looking forward to a bit of rest after becoming king. I want nothing to do with the rest of Europe!
; str_npc14_kingsupport_2b|Hmm. I'm not sure about that. Cu Chulainn had a tragic and early death. I don't want to be linked to him.
; str_npc15_kingsupport_2b|{reg59?Queen:King} of the weak and the poor, maybe. Enough of such talk.
; str_npc16_kingsupport_2b|No disrespect, but I'm not as sure that's what I'd do. Perhaps God would not like that at all.
; str_npc1_kingsupport_3|If I could go about this land for a few weeks, I'd tell the common folk that you would give amnesty to their kinfolk like the Roman -- um, consuls, I think -- of old. Well, soon they would start talking of you as a rightful king, and that would pave your way to the throne. Shall I do that, warlord?
; str_npc2_kingsupport_3|If you like, warlord, I can take a few weeks to visit the areas where I have contacts. I'll explain to them that, in you, they will have a {reg59?ruler:king} who will check the rapacious nobles, who, with their tariffs and taxes, strangle commerce for the sake of a few extra peningas to spend on their wars and their feasts. What do you say to that, warlord?
; str_npc3_kingsupport_3|If you were to protect the poor slaves, even slave girls, I am sure most of the common people would see you as a kind and just {reg59?queen:king}. So, if you can give me a few weeks, I will travel the countryside, telling every poor man and woman that fears enslavement due to debt or war that, under your rule, they would still have protection and rights.
; str_npc4_kingsupport_3|I shall travel about the villages and forts over the next several weeks and spread word of your rights. Of course, I hope that you will remember your faithful subject when it comes to distributing lands after you are a crowned and powerful monarch.
; str_npc5_kingsupport_3|Anyway, {reg59?lady:lord}, if I could take a few weeks, I'd let men know that, when you are {reg59?queen:king}, you will institute a common law, based on tradition and customs, to resolve the disputes within the realm, be they about nobles or commoners. I am pretty sure they will all be more than happy to support your claim, since you will bring justice consistently to all the lands under your rule.
; str_npc6_kingsupport_3|Very well. Although I am now a stranger to my family, I have entered many a noble's hall in your train, and I reckon I would be welcome again. I shall go about this land and tell the nobles that, when you are {reg59?queen:king}, you will strive your hardest to protect the weak and crush discord, so that no man will raise his hand against another with impunity, and one day, perhaps, Britannia will rule over all the world.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_3|I'll tell you what, warlord. Give me a few weeks and I'll go to some of the villages -- stinking hovels that they are, but, anyway, I'll tell the people there that once you unify this land, every man and woman, of every profession and business, will be equally treated and respected when in your service. This way, all will reckon you as a {reg59?woman:man} whose claim to the throne is supported by fairness and justice.
; str_npc8_kingsupport_3|Good! Then give me a few weeks. I'll go about the courts of this land, letting it be known that you're like the legendary warriors of old, and that your strength, courage, prowess and ability alone are more than enough to back up your claim to the throne. Everyone shall speak of you as the new Beowulf, the successor of Arthur himself, the only one capable of bringing peace to this troubled land.
; str_npc9_kingsupport_3|It's perfectly sensible, {reg59?madame:sir}. We'll be free of those cursed merchants' audiences and petitions and scrolls that take up all of my time and yours, when we should both be out fighting for the glory of your kingdom. Give me leave, and I shall spread word among the noble lords of this land that you're here to restore the old ways. I bet, after that, there will plenty who will follow you into battle.
; str_npc10_kingsupport_3|Well then, Dryhten, give me leave for a few weeks, and I can go about this land to let every Saxon noble know that Englaland will belong to them, and to them only, when you are their king. I am certain many of them will be more than happy to join your cause, to support a man with such good judgment of people and nobility.
; str_npc11_kingsupport_3|Then, even though it will hurt me more than anything else, let me be apart from you for a little while. I will travel the land singing of your great conquests, both in war and in love. I will tell how you are like Thor himself, and no one else than you deserves to be Brytenwalda. There's many where I come from who are waiting for a worthy ruler, and I can give the rest a little taste of my spear. Give me a few weeks -- even though it will hurt you too, I know -- and I'll have quite a few expecting you to be their next {reg59?queen:king}.
; str_npc12_kingsupport_3|The crown should go to the one most fit to govern -- which would be you, naturally. Give me a couple of weeks, and I'll write a tract that will prove it. Then I'll find a copyist to post a version in every mead hall in the land. What do you say to that idea, warlord?
; str_npc13_kingsupport_3|Give me leave for a few weeks, {reg59?madame:sir}, and I will let all the worthy men of this land know that you are the one to unite not just Englaland but all the world. For, according to my thinking, no one should be {reg59?king or queen:king} here unless they have the capacity to rule the entire world, and you alone have demonstrated such a capacity, {reg59?madame:sir}.
; str_npc14_kingsupport_3|Allow me to leave you for a few weeks, oh gallant one, and I will spin such a tale as would stir even the dullest heart. It will inspire admiration for your virtues, compassion for your hardships, and indignation at those who would stand in your way. I will show that you are a new Cu Chulainn, ready to make the whole world bend to your will. I assume, of course, that I would be able to take a certain amount of poetic license with the details, like when you single handedly defeated that lost Fomorian army the other day?
; str_npc15_kingsupport_3|I'm glad you think so. Here's what I suggest. I know men that depend on their silver, men like me, who've been picked up and shaken down until they can't take it anymore. Here's what I'll tell them -- you're honest. You respect the merchants. You'll pay your debts. You won't beggar your subjects.
; str_npc16_kingsupport_3|Give me leave for a few weeks, and I'll do a little tour of every church, abbey and monastery in these lands. The whole Church will know that you plan to exterminate, once and for all, the darkness that still lingers around, outside the light of Christianity. Every man that truly fears God, every good Christian, will then support you as God's legitimately appointed ruler. What do you say to that?
; str_npc1_kingsupport_objection|Warlord, have you given leave to someone else to go tell the nobles that they will have rights over pasture, market, and forest? I can't say I like that. Give him his way, and he'll set up gibbets in every village in the land. On every one of them will dangle some poor sod like me who thought he might pick up a bow, head to the woods and put a bit of meat on his table.
; str_npc2_kingsupport_objection|Hmm, warlord. I believe you told someone else that, after you are king, you will help him with something he has in mind. I don't think that his is a good idea at all. He isn't a good man. I do not trust men who drink alone and in silence. They obviously seek to hide what the honesty of mead would reveal.
; str_npc3_kingsupport_objection|Warlord, that dump has set off on some sort of expedition that he says you approved. He says that he will go about the villages of this land and tell the poor villagers that once you are {reg59?queen:king}, you will treat every man and woman, of any profession, as equals. I was happy for the sake of slaves, but when he heard me, he said that slaves are not equal to anyone but deserve nothing more than whippings and beatings. I really hope you did not say that to him, did you?
; str_npc4_kingsupport_objection|I have the feeling that you are playing with me! Why else would you send someone else on the same king support issue, no less than that lunatic?
; str_npc5_kingsupport_objection|Warlord, I overhead what you told, but I think, if you give too many rights and protections to slaves, no one will want to own them any more. Of course, it is possible to live without one, but most rich people really enjoy having one or two slaves to help with the housework and prestige. Nobles also have many, many uses for slaves -- especially the girls. So, you had better not expect rich people and nobles to support you in this matter. It is an inconvenient position for someone that would be {reg59?queen:king}, in my opinion.
; str_npc6_kingsupport_objection|I understand that you have dispatched Egil to fabricate a claim of royal descent. I have to tell you, I do not think that the Heavens will smile on such an attempt to take the throne by fraud, even if it is with good intentions.
; str_npc7_kingsupport_objection|I have heard what you told someone else about this issue. I was especially unhappy to hear the part where he said that Picts are only good as peasants or slaves. This is ridiculous. Pictish warriors will tear your kingdom apart in days if you refuse to share land with them. I really hope you have not agreed with this.
; str_npc8_kingsupport_objection|Warlord, you said that, once you are Brytenwalda, your first war will be against your enemies. This is not right. You should first help me liberate Friese from the Danish. Then both peoples could march against your enemy and share the spoils of the war. Our priority should be Friese.
; str_npc9_kingsupport_objection|{reg59?Madame:Sir}, it is with great regret that I have learned that you have told another that you plan to institute some kind of common law to govern disputes in your kingdom-to-be. This makes no sense at all, since any enlightened ruler will recognize the perfection of Roman imperial law. Even weak Dagobert I, king of the Franks, tries to impose the Roman law whenever and wherever possible. You should follow his example.
; str_npc10_kingsupport_objection|I hear that you've told Agathinos that, once you are {reg59?queen:king}, you will assemble an army composed of warriors from every nation and attempt to recreate the old Roman Empire. This is complete nonsense! Just as only ethnic Romans filled the legions, only a true and pure Saxon army has any chance of recovering their glory. No army with Britonnic rabble in its ranks will ever be able to get off the island, much less conquer the continent. Don't expect me to help your wars if you sabotage yourself by putting Saxons and Britons side by side.
; str_npc11_kingsupport_objection|I hear that another party member is off to sing and spin tales of your glory and fame. I think you're confusing that person with me, because I am plainly the one who sings best among all who are with you. My voice, along with my fame as a skjaldmo, would open halls that most others could only dream of entering.
; str_npc12_kingsupport_objection|Warlord, I hear that you've gone and made that monk, of all people, some sort of ambassador. This two-bit preacher is nothing more than a crazy man, a fanatic. He has already informed me that, once your kingdom is established, any kind of medical research will be forbidden. He claims that his scriptures contain all that one needs to know. If you follow his advice, the world will surely fall into a dark age of ignorance and fear. Enough! I have said my piece.
; str_npc13_kingsupport_objection|I understand that you've sent someone to proclaim that you intend to free all the miscreants of this land upon your accession to the throne. What a foul idea... Men must be governed with whips and chains -- and the noose, if necessary. You'll find that out the hard way if you become {reg59?queen:king}, I'll warrant.
; str_npc14_kingsupport_objection|I hear that you have given that pretty Norse sing-song girl leave to compose ditties that will offend everything the people of this land hold dear. They accuse the old emperors of murder and usurpation. Captain, I know, as a bard, that people must have heroes to emulate, and a golden age to restore. Will you create a kingdom in which cynics and scholars tell us what we must believe? If you teach them not to respect the great rulers of the past, what makes you think they will respect you?
; str_npc15_kingsupport_objection|I understand that you've given leave to another to spread some nonsense about you being the new 'Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon.' I just want to say that, as an educated man, I find it disturbing that you would resort to legends and superstitions to back your claim. Village men and women will believe one thing one day, another thing the next. Now a horoscope, properly cast by an astrologer with a reputation to uphold, might tell you something worth knowing, but those are hard to find in our age of fear and ignorance.
; str_npc16_kingsupport_objection|I hear that Asbjorn's gone off to sing a pretty song to his people of how you'll hand them Englaland on a silver platter for them to feast upon, smack their lips, and suck the marrow from the bones. I hope that's just a tale you're telling. Asbjorn is a pagan and something of a witch. It seems suspicious how he cures the sick. To associate with him can only make everyone think you're a witch, too.
; str_npc1_intel_mission|Well, warlord, as it happens, I have a few cousins over in {s17}. Unlike others in my family, they can still stand the sight of me. They deal in furs --- I've even been able to supply them with stock from time to time -- and so they get to pick up a bit of the gossip round the great halls of the {s18}. I could go over there for a few days and tell you what I find out.
; str_npc2_intel_mission|{reg59?My lady:Sir}, if you're interested in events in the {s18}, I can make contact with my old friends in {s17}. They're usually well informed about political events.
; str_npc3_intel_mission|Warlord, although it has been a long time since I lived in the countryside of {s17} with my father, I still might be able to make contact with some of its older and wiser residents, who enjoyed my father's advice. They are retired merchants, rich farmers, and owners of big herds, the kind of well-to-do people that have some knowledge of politics and affairs. That may tell us much about the state of the {s18}.
; str_npc4_intel_mission|If you could spare me for a few days, I would like to look up an old comrade-in-arms in {s17}, who has from time to time led a small shield wall in the pay of the {s18}. He is a good man, the kind who speaks little and listens much. I'm sure, over a drink or two, he might let me know which way the political winds are blowing in those parts.
; str_npc5_intel_mission|If you like, warlord, I can try to contact some of my family members on the border of the {s18}. My own kin will not betray me and denounce me to the king, so I might be able to gather from them news from all across the {s18}. They may have some gossip about the feuds and rivalries of the great lords, if that is of interest to you.
; str_npc6_intel_mission|On the occasion of the preparations for my trip to West Seaxe, letters were sent to important people of {s17}. If you give me a few days, I may be able to collect some interesting information about the {s18} from those people, who are well aware of the political affairs of the realm.
; str_npc7_intel_mission|Warlord, when I left my former home in {s17}, I promised myself that I would not return except to take vengeance on those who have wronged me. Even though rage burns within my heart, I am occasionally curious as to how my family is getting along. Perhaps I can bring them some gifts, to let them know that I have been successful despite them! Any rate, they are wretched people, but just as a cringing dog keeps its ear to the wind, so do they. They may have useful information about the {s18}, if you would give me a few days to pay them a visit.
; str_npc8_intel_mission|If you have any interest in the events in the {s18}, a former shield-companion of mine retired and keeps a farm near {s17}. He stays in touch with a number of other old warriors. I could visit him for a few days and learn more about what is going on there.
; str_npc9_intel_mission|{reg59?My lady:Sir}, it has been some time since I sampled the delights of {s17}, where gentlefolk such as I are wont to partake of the hospitality of its most puissant and generous lord. If you wish, I could perhaps go there to learn something of the concerns that weigh on the minds of the great peers of the {s18}.
; str_npc10_intel_mission|Dryhten -- I was thinking that some of my old mates in the garrison at {s17} would be glad to see me. They are good lads that would never betray the city, but, like me, they are true Saxon warriors. They may be willing to slip a little political gossip about the incompetence of our lords in finally exterminating the Welsh. The gentry are always falling out over one little thing or the other instead of killing Britons, but the lads might know if there's real dissent brewing.
; str_npc11_intel_mission|{reg59?My pretty:Handsome}, I was thinking that it's been a while since I visited my kin in {s17}. They were among the few that supported me over the years, so I'd like to share with them some of my newfound fortune and news of our love. Then they will surely spill a few tidbits about events in the {s18}, if that would interest you.
; str_npc12_intel_mission|If you wish, Warlord, I would not mind taking the time to pay a visit to a pupil of mine, now employed by the jarl of {s17}. I had great hopes for him, but I have heard that he has lately endorsed the use of muskmelon for the treatment of palsy, on the grounds that its cold essence offsets an abundance of yellow bile. This is a travesty of medicine, and I must journey there to correct him. While I am there, if you wish, I could question him on the latest trends within the {s18}, a topic which may interest you.
; str_npc13_intel_mission|As you may know, I helped train the garrison of {s17}. One of their numbers has lately been in touch with me, suggesting that if I were to visit, he could pass on to me information on events within the {s18}. I am willing to do this, if you can spare me. While it is a great disgrace to be a traitor, there is no dishonor in making use of one.
; str_npc14_intel_mission|With your permission, I was thinking that I might pay a visit to the dales near {s17}. I try not to revisit old pastures, but I must confess a certain curiosity as to how a comely young shepherdess of my former acquaintance is getting along. On the way, I may attempt to stop in at the castle. I suspect that it would not be terribly difficult for me to charm my way into the lord's hall, and I may be able to provide you with the latest news from the {s18}. The lord's wife has a big mouth, and she will surely tell me everything.
; str_npc15_intel_mission|Strategos, as you may know, I have for some time harbored a wish to go to {s17} to study woodworking. As it happens, one of my colleagues is currently engaged there doing repair work on the defenses. While his sense of professional obligation, I think, should prevent him from disclosing to me any weaknesses, I suspect that he would not be averse to offering up his opinion on the general state of the {s18}, if that is of interest to you.
; str_npc16_intel_mission|I may pay a visit to the monastery close to {s17}, where I know some very wise monks and priests. As the defenders of a stronghold of the Church and exponents of God's will in the region, my brothers are well versed in the political situation within the {s18}. I am sure they will keep no secret from me, if that will help us spread the teachings of the Holy Bible throughout these lands.
; str_npc1_fief_acceptance|You make me lord of {s17}, warlord? Well, that will be the kindest thing that anyone has done for me in a long time. Heh, I'll make the most of it. You can count on that! I have to say, though -- I'm not sure how the other lords of this realm will react when they find young Caio in their high company.
; str_npc2_fief_acceptance|{s17} as a fief? Well, I've always thought in terms of mead and women, not in terms of governing anything. But now that you mention it, I bet I could make that place turn a fair bit of revenue. I thank you, {reg59?my lady:my lord}! This is a very kind turn that you have done me.
; str_npc3_fief_acceptance|My {reg59?Lady:Lord}, it is most generous of you to offer me {s17}. Me, an ex-slave! I will be pleased to hold it and will dedicate myself to the moral and material uplifting of its inhabitants. And I will not tolerate any kind of slavery in my fief!
; str_npc4_fief_acceptance|It is good of you to grant me {s17} as a fief -- and most appropriate.
; str_npc5_fief_acceptance|Warlord -- I will be most pleased to hold {s17}. I will send word to Cornubia, to my family, kinsmen, and former servants, and let them know that there is honorable silver and prestige to be earned serving under me in your armies. They will come flocking to fight for you rather than fleeing into Brittany!
; str_npc6_fief_acceptance|I am surprised that you find me worthy to govern men, as I am just beginning to learn to govern myself. But if you indeed wish it, I would be most honored to hold {s17} in your name. I hereby dedicate myself to the protection of those who live there.
; str_npc7_fief_acceptance|Aye, I'll hold {s17} -- and prove to all that Picts are more than capable of ruling and governing land and men, as we did ages ago. Thank you, my {reg59?Lady:Lord}, for this opportunity.
; str_npc8_fief_acceptance|You'd make me a jarl? Well, I suppose that I can postpone other things for a little while longer and make my great hall at {s17}. Someday, I may travel over the seas to fulfill my destiny, but until then, I will be pleased to raise a shield wall of battle-hardened warriors to fight under your banner.
; str_npc9_fief_acceptance|My {reg59?Lady:Lord}, I was cheated of my inheritance, but now, with this offer of an estate, you make right what was wrong. It would give me the greatest honor to serve you, to fight for you, and to hold this land in fief to you.
; str_npc10_fief_acceptance|You'd make me a lord? Well, I think you are right. Saxon warriors are destined to rule all of Britannia. If our current lords are unable to defeat the other nations, then it is natural that truly powerful warriors like I must replace them.
; str_npc11_fief_acceptance|My! You'd grant me a title? There can be no greater sign of your love, can there? My, the strange turns life takes! Fancy this much-maligned virgin finding love and becoming a great peer of a realm. I am nobody's 'old maid' now!
; str_npc12_fief_acceptance|Well, my {reg59?Lady:Lord}, I have to remind you that I don't believe in the holding of land in fief to the king. Farmers and landholders should govern their own affairs under the protection of a distant sovereign. That being said, Englaland has seen far too much bloodshed for us to turn the social order on its head right now. Give me that land, and I'll endeavor to prepare it for a brighter future -- if not in this generation, than perhaps in the next.
; str_npc13_fief_acceptance|You do me a great honor. I will serve faithfully under your banner and shall dedicate every day of my life to raise an organized army and to instill some discipline in our soldiers. Soon, with that army, we shall together submit all of world to your rule.
; str_npc14_fief_acceptance|How generous and kind of you, my {reg59?Lady:Lord}. Allow me to express the utmost reverence for your wisdom in selecting me. Truly, your perspicacity exceeds that of King Solomon, who could read the entire nature of a man from a single hair of his head. Your judgment surpasses that of the emperor, Marcus Aurelius, to whom even the most prominent patricians submitted their disputes. Anyway, I accept.
; str_npc15_fief_acceptance|You do me a great honor, strategos. In Konstantinoupolis, a youngest son such as I am has no opportunity to possess a fief of his own, but here, there is still the chance for a man to win with his sword what was denied him by his birth! I shall hold {s17} as your vassal and build a corps of engineers to build your fortresses, palaces, and empire.
; str_npc16_fief_acceptance|You truly fear God and respect his will. This is good. {s17} will become a center of faith and truth. It will be a powerful beacon against the shadows of paganism and heresy that still haunt this land. May the peace of God be with you.
; str_npc3_woman_to_woman|My lady, if you don't mind my saying, I think by now you have proven yourself to be one of the great warriors of this realm. Yet strangely, no king has come forward to offer you a fief. Perhaps it is because you are a woman. No matter -- I personally believe that you will take your place among the great lords of this realm, even if you have to fight twice as long and twice as hard to receive your due!
; str_npc7_woman_to_woman|Warlord, if you don't mind my saying, you have fought long and hard against every kind of warrior in the world. With their defeat, you brought great honor to yourself. You well deserve of a fief of your own. I suspect that if you were not a woman, a king would have offered you one by now. That is the way of the men in this sorry land: they let us stand in the front of the battle line to take the enemy's blows, but when it comes to a division of the spoils, they expect us to head to the rear.
; str_npc11_woman_to_woman|My Pretty, I just can't help thinking to myself -- you've made quite a name for yourself, haven't you? Fighting and marching up and down the length of the land. Why, I suspect if you were a man, some king would have offered you a fief by now. Well, you may still get what you deserve! You'll just have to prove yourself a bit more, and I shall stay at your side to help you do it!
; str_npc1_turn_against|I'm sorry that we meet like this, warlord. There's no question that I owe my rise in life to you. You doubtless think me ungrateful. However, one has to follow one's destiny... Isn't that correct?
; str_npc2_turn_against|This is a sad day. I never thought that I might meet my old warlord on the field of battle. Even if I triumph, it will bring me no joy.
; str_npc3_turn_against|Oh {playername}! What a tragic turn our lives have taken! I can only hope that the strange tides that have currently made us enemies will one day allow us to be friends once more.
; str_npc4_turn_against|Aye, well.... I'm not sure what to say. Let's get this fight over with.
; str_npc5_turn_against|{playername}! It is a shame that we must now battle after so many glorious victories together. Anyway, today I come against you with my sword raised, but I hope that, one day, we instead will raise a glass together, to a friendship renewed.
; str_npc6_turn_against|It grieves me, more than anything I can say, to meet you like this, {playername}. I shall not dwell on the circumstances that have led us to this point. I can only hope that we may one day be reconciled.
; str_npc7_turn_against|Well, old leader. You made of me a great lady, and for that, I am grateful. However, you can never own me, and now the circumstances have caused our interests to clash. I meet you in battle with a clear conscience. Still, I hope someday that circumstances may change again. Even though you will now suffer defeat, I hope we may meet as friends again.
; str_npc8_turn_against|So, we meet now as enemies and may shortly face each other over the rims of our shields. A grim day this is. The spinners of fate have a dark sense of humor.
; str_npc9_turn_against|I will not accept fault for the circumstances that have led us to become enemies. I want you to know that my conscience is clear, although my heart is heavy.
; str_npc10_turn_against|Well, it looks like the tides of fate have led me to make war on my old dryhten. Maybe things started to go wrong when you became my liege. I suppose I was never much suited to vassalage. Anyway, here we are now. Prepare to be defeated.
; str_npc11_turn_against|Great Thor, my heart is now officially broken. So it looks like you and I are enemies. Didn't I always sing how life and love takes us on some very strange turns? The Norns play with us -- to turn love into hate so easily. Nevertheless, keep up your defenses, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}. I will not go easy on you, for all I will try not to mar that face of yours overly much!
; str_npc12_turn_against|So, it seems we must fight. I would have you know, {reg59?my lady:sir}, that I have not betrayed you. I had never served you as a man, but served the principles that I believed you upheld. As you no longer uphold them, I must do my best to thwart you, but I bear you no ill will. I hope that you will change again, so that we can meet again someday as friends.
; str_npc13_turn_against|Well, {playername}. We meet as enemies. I confess that I have mixed feelings. It grieves me to make war on you, but if we meet in battle and I prevail, I will have defeated the worthiest foe. Then I will know that my mastery of the military art is complete!
; str_npc14_turn_against|It is sad to meet you as my enemy. On the other hand, to meet such a titan of the battlefield as you in combat is a rare privilege. Truly, the news of our contest today shall keep the bards and poets of these lands in mead and silver for months to come, don't you think?
; str_npc15_turn_against|Ah... I have not been looking forward to this day. I just want to say that, in my view, if you'd kept your faith in me, things would never have come to this. But no doubt you see it differently.
; str_npc16_turn_against|I now see that, for the whole time we travelled together, you intended only to use and deceive me. Your soul belongs to the Devil, and the darkness of passion for the old gods lingers within your heart. For the cause of Christ, I must now defeat you in the field. Do not doubt that God is by my side today. Nothing but defeat is prepared for you right now.
; str_comment_intro_liege_affiliated|I am told that you are pledged to one of the pretenders who dispute my claim to the crown, but we may still talk.
; str_comment_intro_famous_liege|Your fame runs before you! Perhaps it is time that you sought a liege worthy of your valor.
; str_comment_intro_famous_martial|Your fame runs before you! Perhaps we shall test each other's valor in a tournament, or on the battlefield!
; str_comment_intro_famous_badtempered|I've heard of you. Well, I'm not one for bandying words, so if you have anything to say, out with it.
; str_comment_intro_famous_pitiless|I know your name. It strikes fear in men's hearts. That is good. Perhaps we should speak together, some time.
; str_comment_intro_famous_cunning|Ah, yes. At last we meet. You sound like a good {reg59?woman:man} to know. Let us speak together, from time to time.
; str_comment_intro_famous_sadistic|I know your name -- and from what I hear, I'll warrant that many a grieving widow knows too. But that is no concern of mine.
; str_comment_intro_famous_goodnatured|I've heard of you! It's very good to finally make your acquaintance.
; str_comment_intro_famous_upstanding|I know your name. They say you are a most valiant warrior. I can only hope that your honour and mercy matches your valor.
; str_comment_intro_noble_liege|I see that you carry a {reg59?noble's:nobleman's} banner, although I do not recognize the device. Know that I am always looking for good {reg59?warriors:men} to fight for me, once they prove themselves to be worthy of my trust.
; str_comment_intro_noble_martial|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. No matter -- a brave {reg59?warrior's:man's} home is all the world, or so they say!
; str_comment_intro_noble_badtempered|I don't recognize the device on your banner. No doubt another foreigner come to our lands, as if we didn't have so many here already.
; str_comment_intro_noble_pitiless|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Another vulture come to grow fat on the leftovers of war, no doubt!
; str_comment_intro_noble_cunning|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Still, it is always worthwhile to make the acquaintance of {reg59?women:men} who may one day prove themselves to be great warriors.
; str_comment_intro_noble_sadistic|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Perhaps you are the bastard {reg59?daughter:son} of a puffed-up cattle thief? Or perhaps you stole it?
; str_comment_intro_noble_goodnatured|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. Forgive my ignorance, {reg59?my lady:sir}! It is good to make your acquaintance.
; str_comment_intro_noble_upstanding|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the device. No doubt you have come to these lands in search of wealth and glory. If this indeed is the case, then I only ask that you show mercy to those poor souls caught in the path of war.
; str_comment_intro_common_liege|You may be of common birth, but know that I am always looking for good men to fight for me, if they can prove themselves to be worthy of my trust.
; str_comment_intro_common_martial|Perhaps you are not of gentle birth, but even a commoner, be {reg59?she:he} of sufficient valor, may make something of {reg59?herself:himself} someday.
; str_comment_intro_common_badtempered|Speak quickly, if you have anything to say, for I have no time to be bandying words with common soldiers of fortune.
; str_comment_intro_common_pitiless|You have the look of a mercenary, another vulture come to grow fat on the misery of this land.
; str_comment_intro_common_cunning|Well... I have not heard of you, but you have the look of a {reg59?woman:man} who might make something of {reg59?herself:himself}, someday.
; str_comment_intro_common_sadistic|Normally I cut the throats of impudent commoners who barge into my presence uninvited, but I am in a good mood today.

; str_rebellion_refuse_cunning|I am sorry. You do not give me reason for confidence that you will win. Many will die, but I do not wish to be among them. I will continue to back {s46}.

; str_sarranid_rebellion_pretender_intro|Hello, foreigner. I am Cadwallon. I stand before you as the last heir of the kings of Gwynedd.
; str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_1|My father saved our people while that bastard, King Horik, was raiding abroad. He didn't think about what would happen if he left this land without any soldiers to protect it! My father was the one who did it!
; str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_1|I had been the heir to my father's crown for 30 years, but last year that old mummy decided he wanted a new young lady to 'refresh' his life, if you know what I mean.
; str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_1|The Danish razed my lands. Supplied by that coward of a king of East Engle, they rode up from the south. Figuring that they were bent on revenge against King Aelle, each lord protected only his fief rather than heed the king's summons. But the Danes wanted everything. With only my own retainers, I knew I could not prevent them from taking my inheritance.
; str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_1|My father was the king of Cent, the current king's brother. He honored his father, Aethelwulf, unlike his next brother, Aethelbald, who stole the throne and married his father's wife.
; str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_1|For the last fifteen years, I rode through this land with my boys giving protection to the villages just for a couple of coins and food. Just what we deserve.
; str_sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_1|I am the namesake of my ancestor, who defeated Eadwine of Deria in the battle of Haethfelth Chase. After that, we were kicked from the throne, and my family had to live far from the crown... until now.
; str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2|When the king came back from his adventure with tons of silver and those odd crosses, he was afraid of us. My father had inspired much loyalty among those who were here when the bandits attacked. That coward kicked us out of our own homes! Just a few months later my father committed suicide, unable to live with the dishonor. Since then, I have been living with people loyal to our cause, those who knew that the real leader of our people was my father.
; str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_2|Unfortunately for me, that little Queen is really fertile, and they have had a child, with the king being 62 years old... After so many years of poisoning his wives in order to abort their legitimate heirs... now this! It appears that my father would rather have a child heir than a bastard adult heir.
; str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_2|All who had not openly joined them, they kicked off their ancestral lands. Just like that, the kingdom that had lasted centuries disappeared. Our forefathers would be ashamed.
; str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_2|Before all that, unfortunately, my father died defending the kingdom from the first invasion of the Danish under Ragnar Lodbrok sixteen years ago. The incestuous Aethelbald then enjoyed the fruits of my father's sacrifice, dying in peace nine years later. I was still considered too young to assume a throne, and my uncles Aethelbehrt and Aethelred ascended through the kingships of Cent and Wessex in turn.
; str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_2|Only the big cities have turned us down. They said the real danger was us, that we didn't give them protection, and that we were extortionists. But these are all lies, damned lies! The actual thieves are those who call themselves tiarna and the worst one is that son-of-a-usurper king.
; str_sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_2|The kingdom has suffered greatly the last few years with the usurpers at its helm. I think the masses have had enough. They would support me in a fight for the throne.
; str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3|The whole kingdom owes its existence to my father and those who fought next to him, people like my men and I. I have enough men to take the capital and defend it while another brave man like you can conquer and defend the other strongholds. Together, we can take back what King Horik owes me.
; str_vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_3|But his new dynasty is not going to survive long. The other members of our clan are already jostling for power. A strong king would keep them united against our enemies! I need your help to support my rights to the crown, for my father will never accept me over his last son. We need to fight for the future of the kingdom.
; str_khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_3|However, I have since united all my people under my banner again. I have gathered even more men that any of my ancestors, but I'm afraid I need more good leaders. Some of the best commanders died in futile resistance to the Danes. I can offer you to lead one of my armies, and, if we achieve our goal, you might have your own city to rule.
; str_nord_rebellion_pretender_story_3|It is clear to me that my grandfather's line weakened successively after my father. Aethelred is too pious and Aelfred too bookish; together they have been unsuccessful resisting the Danish. I am more like my father. I can vigorously defend this land. With your help, we will bring peace and prosperity back to our kingdom, and perhaps all Britain.
; str_rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_3|We are planning to assault the thief's main castle and end his reign of fear. The people of this land will pay only us for protection; I will not tolerate any competition. Join me and my band, and I will bury you in so much silver that you will be able to swim in it. I will give you a collection commission!
; str_sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_3|I just need good captains for my armies and, if possible, good soldiers under them. Together we will revive my family's honor and obtain the position that I deserve. Come with me, gather your soldiers, and our names will never be forgotten. Swear by me, and you will never regret it.
; str_swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1|That child again is pretending to be the true king over my lands... I should have sent him farther away when I had a chance. Without all the silver we brought, this kingdom would be nothing. If I had any idea that my lands would be razed by bandits, I would have never taken so many soldiers with me.
; str_vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_1|That young man will never understand his place in this world. He is a bastard. He will never have any rights except the ones he earns in service to his lord. He is my son, but he will never be king, not even if my little baby dies someday.
; str_khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Who? I don't know that name. The Danish help me establish my claim, and there is nothing left for those who have lost their right to the land.
; str_nord_rebellion_monarch_response_1|My nephew was a good knight some years ago. Then he started to associate with certain of his father's retainers and now believes only what they say. They've put notions in his head, thinking to regain positions of influence.
; str_rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_1|He is nothing but a bandit. For the last few years, he has been extorting silver from my villages. He pretends to be the protector of those villages from 'bandits,' when it is they who are the bandits!
; str_sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_1|It is true that we are going through tough times, but the people know it is because our merchants have been suffering under constant raids. Now that I know he is in my kingdom, I can say he is the one responsible for those attacks.
; str_swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_2|They can try to attack us, but they don't have enough men to take even one of my villages, ha! Take my advice. Ignore him. He will never be anything but a chatterbox.
; str_vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_2|Only if he came and knelt in front of me would I will be willing to forgive his faults and let him live somewhere far away from my legitimate son.
; str_khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_2|I will not tolerate any pretender to my crown. He and everyone who supports him will be arrested if they try anything unlawful. These are my people now, and I will protect them.
; str_nord_rebellion_monarch_response_2|I do not desire to bind his hands, but I have my mine full with the Danish and can't be on guard against a possible back stab. No one controls events, and the succession moves on. He never understood this.
; str_rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_2|They are going to suffer for the pain they have caused my people. Not one of them will survive.
; str_sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_2|It is my duty to protect all of my people from any danger in my kingdom. I will capture him and we will have a 'talk.' This situation can't stay like this any longer.
