You, yourself do not know how you feel. Somebody said once that war changes people, that it is a voracious demon that devours your soul. Have you changed?

The storms of winter will harm your ships, but calm weather isn't much better, because it forces your men to row.

Perhaps, given his spotless record of wins, he can't be said to be too confident. Your companions give you pats on the back, advice and wishes for good luck. All but Reginhard, who is pessimistic and says he will record the runes on your gravestone. Suddenly, Egil points toward Orm. The berserker has ceased to warm up his muscles.

; menu_the_holmgang|A group of heavily armed men approaches you. It is led by Harald Haraldsson, king's right hand, who reminds you of your promise at the Assembly. It is the hour of the holmgang and your opponent is already on Short Island. They surround your party and lead you to a nearby beach, where a gaunt old man waits in a small boat. You get in the boat, and two of Harald's men push it into the water. The old man, without a word to you, begins paddling toward an island on the horizon.
mno_choice_01_1duel|Continua.
; menu_the_holmgang2|The water is gentle. The only sound you hear is that of the oars on the water, striking in a slow and deliberate rhythm. The old man is not so old, but wrinkles of a hard life at sea make him look like an elder. He wears a worn and salt-bleached tunic, and the skin of his hands look like hard leather. His eyes are blue and crystal clear and do not look directly at you even for a moment, but remain focused on the island. Up ahead awaits an opponent who once was a companion. The Assembly has decided that two go to Short Island, but only one return. The boat stops near a small beach, and after you get off, the old man paddles it a few tens of meters back into the ocean, where he stops and waits.

In your mind, you remember the phrase that you heard so often from Reginhard: Gaed a wyrd swa hio scel! Fate always goes as she must!^^The old man takes the boat back to where your warriors await in Danmark. When you arrive, they pick up their things and say nothing, aware of the gravity of the moment. Soon they are ready to go. Harald and his men have already left. It's time to look for the Assembly judge called Asbjorn in the mead hall of Ribe.
; menu_the_thing|In a setting reminiscent of times past, when men lifted huge rocks to venerate their dead or glorify their gods, meets the Assembly. As you approach, you hear more clearly hundreds of voices, distinguish the tents, and smell the food from the merchant stands.

; menu_partida_ribe_fleet|Since your arrival, there has been a great hubbub in the port of Ribe. Eight hundred Vikings and their captains have been boarding their ships in order of arrival, while slaves load baggage, supplies, and even animals. Most of the ships are the Knorr type, cargo ships, but there are also a good two dozen warships.^^You spend nights on your ship, while during the day you help as you can. Your warriors kill time enjoying the hospitality of the neighbors and happy widows. You have had no chance to get close to Sven Bull Neck or, rather, to his ship, but you hear that he and Harald, the two people in charge of the fleet, have been arguing over all types of stupid things. Some of Harald's men have even been stabbed in the streets.^^Finally, after everyone has prepared for the long journey, the fleet rows out of Ribe to follow the Whale Route, leaving Danmark behind.
; menu_partida_ribe_fleet2|By now, the differences between Sven Bull Neck, protected by Jarl Sigurd, and Harald Haraldsson, protected by King Horik, are so clear that the fleet progresses divided in two, depending on who supports which commander.^^But it's not the time for worry. The sea brings wind and the freedom of the waves, and your ship is heading for Englaland where rivers carry silver and men get fame. And now you're closer than ever to Sven Bull Neck. You just wait for your chance to kill him and rescue your mother... Fate always rewards the patient.
; menu_sven_attack_fleet|The journey from Ribe to Eoferwic or, as the Danish call it, Jorvik is three days with good weather, but with the slower knorrs, the trip will take a day or two more. The ships have spread out, but this is usual. When traveling with sail, the winds govern at will. The ships will reunite at their destination.^^A long trip like this requires a routine. Men take turns in the work of the boat, even at night, because the fleet never stops offshore. The smell of the crowded men is horrible, the water you drink and food you eat taste terrible, and it is always uncomfortable having to peer over the stern when you want to relieve yourself.^^Eventually, the rift between Harald and Sven becomes open. Each now meets separately with the captains who are faithful to him. Each part of the fleet proceeds separately. Harald has called you and the other captains to his boat for an emergency meeting. Apparently, one of the captains faithful to Sven Bull Neck has changed his allegiance to Harald and brings news.^^You look forward to the meeting as well. Maybe there is finally news of your mother.
; mno_choice_mettingcap|Captains' meeting.
; menu_playerflee_svenattack|Behind you fades the battle, the pitiful cries of the wounded, and the clash of swords.

; menu_way_to_douaranenez|You gather the fleet and immediately the sailors cast off the boats and pull the halyards to raise the sails. The cloth is stirred, moved by the morning breeze, and the ships begin to move. The captains shout orders to their crews, which start to row. Moved by sail and oars, the fleet leaves the harbor and heads for open water.
; menu_way_to_douaranenez2|You spend days at sea, uncomfortable on a boat with so many men, where there is no space for privacy and tranquillity. The smell of stale sweat, urine and sebum fills the air, even above the salty scent of the sea.^The climate is mild: no storms, no wind, despite the early appearance of fog. In fact, with so little wind, the fleet advances slowly, making the trip longer.^^Finally, from a nearby ship, one of the lookouts points to the horizon, and you can see Douar-an-Enez. In the bay of the village, there are more than 40 boats, many of them in the sea, lashed together in battle formation. One ship leaves the group and heads towards you...
; mno_choice_d1|Join the parley.
; menu_way_to_douaranenez3|Behind you, you hear discussion in the village. There seems to be dissension in the camp of the Astures. You hear swords and shouting.^^But none of that matters to you at the moment. In full sail, a Cantabrian ship takes you to where your boat awaits. You see, in the distance, your fleet maneuvering to confront their attackers. Gundinsalvo travels with you. He is serious, very serious, despite the buffoonery at the meeting. He looks to where the two fleets jockey for position with their oars. His face is fierce, that of a seasoned warrior who does not fear death. As soon as your ship arrives, it rows toward your fleet.

You remember how Bodo died in the fight and last time you shared with him. His mission failed with persistent inevitability. There is no longer a fleet from the Kingdom of Asturias, only a few Cantabrians who have joined your cause after losing their own leader, Gundinsalvo. Now you are their leader.

He is still immersed in his prayers and has ordered not to be disturbed until finished. The Danish don't wait. They divide their own army into two in their advance. One division under the army leaders, Jarl Halfdan and King Bagsecg, heads straight for the hosts of Aethelred. The other, under five other jarls, moves in the direction of Aelfred.
