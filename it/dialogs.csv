dlga_port_chief2:port_chief3|Che cosa volete?
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_fleet1|Salve. Sono venuto per far parte della flotta di Sven Bull Neck e Harald Haraldsson che andranno a Englaland.
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_bodoletter1|Un uomo chiamato Atli Eiriksson ha lasciato questo porto un pò di tempo fa. Sa dove stava andando?
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_pieles|Ho dato le pelli a Hogni, ora tocca a te. Dove si trova Atli Eiriksson?

dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_svenlair|Sai quello che voglio. Dove si trova il nascondiglio di Sven Bull Neck?
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_buy_ship|Voglio comprare una nave.
dlga_port_chief_buy_ship:close_window|Seguimi!
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_info_main|Ho alcune domande su navi e viaggi in mare.
dlga_port_chief_info_main:port_chief_info_main_1|Cosa volete sapere?
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief_info_a_1|Perché la gente va al mare?
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief_info_b_1|Come mi oriento in mare?
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief_info_c_1|Che cosa serve per comprare una nave?
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief_info_d_1|Cosa rende una nave veloce?
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief2|Questo è quello che volevo sapere. Grazie!
dlga_port_chief_info_a_1:port_chief_info_main|Puoi guadagnare un sacco di soldi vendendo merci o schiavi attraverso il mare. Altri lo fanno per razziare gli insediamenti. Inoltre, nessun Viking ti rispeterà come un leader se non hai una buona nave.
dlga_port_chief_info_b_1:port_chief_info_main|Guarda il sole al giorno. Riposa durante la notte. Più bravo sei a trovare la strada, piu velocemente viaggi.
dlga_port_chief_info_c_1:port_chief_info_c_2|In primo luogo, è necessario sapere che tipo di nave ti serve. Se vuoi commerciare, una Knorr può essere una buona scelta. Hanno molto spazio per il carico, ma non sono molto veloci. Le Snekkja, le Skei e le Busse sono navi da guerra veloci e sono in grado di trasportare molte truppe. La Karvi è una via di mezzo. Se avete solo pochi uomini, va bene una piccola nave come la Byrding che forse è più utile.
dlga_port_chief_info_c_2:port_chief_info_main|Il secondo fattore importante è di che tipo di legno è fatta la nave. Navi in legno di quercia sono le navi migliori, ma sono anche costose. Il faggio è più conveniente, ma si rovina più velocemente.
dlga_port_chief_info_d_1:port_chief_info_main|Il vento -- se avete delle vele in grado di prenderlo meglio. Se non c'è vento, allora il tuo equipaggio deve remare. Più Vogatori renderà la nave più veloce. Se avete più di una nave nella flotta, la flotta viaggerà come la tua nave più lenta. Anche un navigatore esperto può rendere la tua flotta più veloce.
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_travel|Voglio viaggiare verso un'altro porto.

How about 12,000 peningas? Do you have this kind of money? If not, perhaps you could do me a little favor instead. I have a client who needs to move some furs to Dubh Linn, in Eriuland.

We mostly fight against neighboring clans, where rivalry tends to flourish, but many times larger clans lead others to wars between kingdoms, because the most important men of the island aspire to the throne of Tara. Being the master of Tara means you are the high king, Ard Ruire, of all Eriu, and that brings much glory for your clan.
; dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp2:donnachdh_conversationcamp3|So many rivalries make things easy for the Vikings.
; dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp2:donnachdh_conversationcamp3_2|So many wars produce very tough warriors.
; dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp2:donnachdh_conversationcamp3_3|Someone should unite all the clans.
; dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp2:close_window|I'm interested very little in this.
; dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp3:donnachdh_conversationcamp4|I admit that the Vikings have managed to become strong in some parts of the island, but they are as divided as we are. In fact, I dare say that they are already part of the way we do things in Eriu. It is not uncommon to see Vikings fighting alongside Goidels against other Vikings. The kings of Eriu have taken to hiring them as mercenaries, and Vikings often serve rival clans who face each other.
; dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp3_2:donnachdh_conversationcamp4|Yes, that's true. War eliminates the weakest and forces men to learn how fight. It is definitely a good place to get warriors for your army. On the other hand, if you let yourself be entangled by Goidelic politics or you try to become king of Tara, you will realize that the island has certain political traditions and that nothing you do will ever change Eriu.
; dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp3_3:donnachdh_conversationcamp4|All men and clans covet the throne of Tara, but really hardly anyone is capable of sitting in it. Those who try tend to have short lives, but always another man and another clan come along, and the cycle continues. If the throne of Tara is ever yours, may you enjoy it as long as possible. Your clan will be famous and respected, but your life will be very short.
; dlga_donnachdh_conversationcamp4:close_window|Surely, Eriu, or Hibernia, as the Romans called it, is a different land. Forget everything you know, Eriu is different!
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:donnachdh_dwywei_conv1|Every time I give an order in your name, Dwywei questions my authority among your men. Now she is gathering with some warriors to mutter against me. I do not understand this hate, as we both are from the same kingdom.
; dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv1:donnachdh_dwywei_conv2|The Scots of Dal Riata are bloody traitors. They came from Eriu to take our western lands. Some years ago, we lost our beloved king Bridei fighting against the Norsemen, and most of the Pictish nobility died with him. Then Cinaed mac Ailpin, the king of Dal Riata, disputed the Pictish crown with the surviving members of the seven royal houses of the Picts.
; dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv2:donnachdh_dwywei_conv3|-- She grits her teeth --^^Cinaed defeated us in battle and later met all claimants to the Pictish crown at Scone. They feasted while mead and ale flowed freely. What happened next is known as Mac Ailpin's treason: 'the Conqueror' killed all our nobles and became the only claimant for the Pictish Crown. Now his successor, the king of Alban, rules over both the Picts and the Scots. Who can trust in this traitor's race? Me? No!
; dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv3:donnachdh_dwywei_conv4|Stupid and stubborn Picts...
; dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv4:donnachdh_dwywei_conv5|Forget this old enmity. Now you have a common enemy. Together you must face the Norsemen.
; dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv4:donnachdh_dwywei_conv6|I understand your concern about the Scots, but Donnachdh has proven to be a man of honor.
; dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv4:donnachdh_dwywei_conv7|Is this how Scots are? Then I hate them, too. Dirty traitors!
; dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv5:close_window|As you wish.
; dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv6:close_window|I understand that Donnachdh is not guilty of what happened. I'll try being nicer to him.
; dlga_donnachdh_dwywei_conv7:close_window|I hope, for your sake, that you are kidding, but I don't find you so funny.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:morgant_conversationcamp1|{reg59?My lady:Sir}, in Cornubia men with guts are a dying breed. In the past, we were a proud people, and our holdings stretched across southern Britannia. Then the Saxons came, and we lost the land.
; dlga_morgant_conversationcamp1:morgant_conversationcamp2|Now the sea brings the Danish, as previously it did the Angles and the Saxons. Now, the Saxons fear losing this land they took from us to the Danish. Isn't fate ironic?
; dlga_morgant_conversationcamp2:morgant_conversationcamp3|Sure, but don't bother me about Saxons. They will lose what they stole.
; dlga_morgant_conversationcamp2:morgant_conversationcamp3_2|The Saxons are strong. They will resist the Danish.
; dlga_morgant_conversationcamp2:close_window|I have very little interest in this.
; dlga_morgant_conversationcamp3:morgant_conversationcamp4|It is possible. Maybe God has a sense of humor or our prayers have brought the Danish to punish the Saxons. But who cares? Britannia is lost to the Britons.
; dlga_morgant_conversationcamp3_2:morgant_conversationcamp4|You mean we were weak? I think not! It is true that we were disunited and unlucky with our kings, but Arthur showed that it was possible to defeat the Saxons. We can only regret that there was no one to pick up his legacy. Britannia is now lost for us.
; dlga_morgant_conversationcamp4:morgant_conversationcamp5|Britannia will be returned to the Britons. I swear I will do it.
; dlga_morgant_conversationcamp4:morgant_conversationcamp5_1|Forget the past and focus on the present.
; dlga_morgant_conversationcamp5:close_window|I appreciate your words, but both of us know that, even if you conquer the whole island, Britannia of today has nothing in common with Britannia of yore. It will not be the same.
; dlga_morgant_conversationcamp5_1:close_window|Yes, you're right. There is little sense in mourning the past. Let us return to the present.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:dwywei_conversationcamp1|{playername}, my parents were important people in Pictland, and their grandparents before them, and all my ancestors. They were descendants on the maternal side -- the one that matters to Picts -- of royal blood.
; dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp1:dwywei_conversationcamp2|However, there have been many changes in the kingdom known as Alban. Our people are mixing with our old enemies, the Goidels of Dal Riata, and my family was disgraced. I tried to recover our prestige as a warrior, but since the Picts embraced Christ, women have been excluded from this profession more and more each day. Ultimately, I failed, and my family paid with their lives for my failure.
; dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp2:dwywei_conversationcamp3|I do not normally talk about this, but I would like to say I have found a new family while traveling with you. This helps me to ease the burden of my past. For years, I hated the current kings of Alban. Now I don't care any more. My failure and the new laws of our land brought about the end of my family. I just pray that you don't judge me harshly for my past.
; dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp3:dwywei_conversationcamp4|What happened is in the past. You are very important to me.
; dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp3:dwywei_conversationcamp4_2|Thanks for sharing your story with me. I'm glad you found peace with yourself.
; dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp3:close_window|You caused the death of your family, and you do not want to be judged harshly? Nonsense!
; dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp4:close_window|--She looks down shyly--^^You are also very important to me. Oh, well, I have things to do.
; dlga_dwywei_conversationcamp4_2:close_window|Thank you for your understanding.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:dwyweiromance_conversationcamp1|{playername}, although you see me fight hard in battles, mark my body with war paint, and scream while I stab our enemies...
; dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp1:dwyweiromance_conversationcamp3|You know I'm a shy person, right?
; dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp3:dwyweiromance_conversationcamp4|I did not know that.
; dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp3:dwyweiromance_conversationcamp4_2|Yes, I know.
; dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp3:close_window|I have little time now to hear about this. We'll talk later.
; dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp4:close_window|Oh, I see. Well, well, I... we'll talk another day...
; dlga_dwyweiromance_conversationcamp4_2:close_window|What I mean is that I can say things, but I want you to know that I admire and appreciate you very much. Well, I do not want to talk more about this. It is cumbersome. We'll talk another day.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp1|I need to talk to you, {playername}. It is a very serious issue for me, but I will raise it only once.
; dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp1:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp3|You know I'm interested in you, appreciate you and like you. I think you feel the same way when you look at me, but I'm not sure. Can it be...?
; dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp3:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp4|Yes, Dwywei, I like you a lot.
; dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp3:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp4_2|Sorry, but I'm not interested in you.
; dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp4:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp5|I am happy to hear you say that! I guess this means we're together, yes?
; dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp4_2:close_window|I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I feel embarrassed. I thought... I was wrong. Sorry, I will not bother you any more. Now, I have things to do.
; dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp5:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp6|Yes, Dwywei, you are my woman now.
; dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp5:dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp7|No. It was just a joke. I'm not interested in you at all.
; dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp6:close_window|I am so happy! I love you. I am going to put my things in your tent!
; dlga_dwyweiromance2_conversationcamp7:close_window|A joke? You're a jerk! What kind of person kids about things like that? Leave me alone. I do not want to see you any more.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:reginhard1_conversationcamp1|My friend, some of your men are muttering because the food is disgusting. Do you want their names?
; dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp1:reginhard1_conversationcamp2|I really appreciate your concern, Reginhard.
; dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp2:reginhard1_conversationcamp3|Well, err... I know you are a generous man. I'm sure you will reward my fidelity someway... You know what I mean, right?
; dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp3:close_window|Sure. Take this money and keep me informed.
; dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp3:close_window.1|Shut up, you greedy scum. Don't try to cheat me again.
; dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp3:close_window.2|I always reward every man as he deserves. Don't forget that.
; dlga_reginhard1_conversationcamp3:close_window.3|It won't be necessary. Tomorrow the food will be better.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:clovis1_conversationcamp1|Warlord, I think it's necessary to train our men more. Haven't you read Vegetius? The ancients knew how to convert simple farmers into great soldiers in just a few days.
; dlga_clovis1_conversationcamp1:clovis1_conversationcamp2|I can force them to practice harder. Trust me. You will see how I transform them into veteran warriors.
; dlga_clovis1_conversationcamp2:close_window|Alright, let them sweat, but I want good results. Take these 1000 peningas to reward the best.
; dlga_clovis1_conversationcamp2:close_window.1|That is a good idea. I appoint you weapon master.
; dlga_clovis1_conversationcamp2:close_window.2|They are tired; I don't want to force them... for now. But I appreciate your offer.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:ceawlin1_conversationcamp1|I want to tell you something important. A war band has to be led by a man of honor, but these times are too hard for mercy. The warriors need a strong leader, someone able to make hard decisions when they are needed.
; dlga_ceawlin1_conversationcamp1:ceawlin1_conversationcamp2|--You realize some of your men hear the conversation--^^Only a fool can consider mercifulness as weakness.
; dlga_ceawlin1_conversationcamp2:ceawlin1_conversationcamp3|Just so, but fear converts men into fools. Don't be weak, {playername}. They smell fear, like dogs.
; dlga_ceawlin1_conversationcamp3:close_window|I appreciate your concern, but I know how to manage my people.
; dlga_ceawlin1_conversationcamp3:close_window.1|Maybe you are right, my friend. I will follow your advice.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:ailchu1_conversationcamp1|I have reconsidered my opinion about Brunhild. Maybe she can be a good warrior after all. Do you know why?
dlga_ailchu1_conversationcamp1:ailchu1_conversationcamp2|Sto ascoltando.
; dlga_ailchu1_conversationcamp2:ailchu1_conversationcamp3|Because she can bleed for a week and not die! Ha, ha, ha... Seriously, is she really necessary here? Her constant gossiping gives me headaches.
; dlga_ailchu1_conversationcamp3:close_window|Seriously, you give me headaches. Yet I keep you...
; dlga_ailchu1_conversationcamp3:close_window.1|If you are not comfortable here, you are free to go.
; dlga_ailchu1_conversationcamp3:close_window.2|Maybe a war band is not a good place for her. I'll think about it.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:caio_conversationcamp1|In your army, I visit so many places and meet so many people. I didn't realize the world was so big!
; dlga_caio_conversationcamp1:caio_conversationcamp2|Honestly, my family and I lived in the cave all this time, only going to the Wall to sell goods. Once I visited Bebbanburh, and I thought that was the greatest and most wonderful place. That was nothing compared to the places you take me now.
; dlga_caio_conversationcamp2:caio_conversationcamp3|And there are still many more places for you to visit.
; dlga_caio_conversationcamp2:caio_conversationcamp4|Why are you bothering me with this?
; dlga_caio_conversationcamp3:close_window|I'm sure there are plenty of places to visit. I can only say that joining you was the best decision of my life. I will never return to the cave of my parents.
; dlga_caio_conversationcamp4:close_window|Ah, excuse me, sorry. I understand that for someone like you, this is very trivial, but for me it's so new. I will not bother you with my silly talk any longer. Farewell.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:caio_morgant_conv1|I want to ask to you about...
; dlga_caio_morgant_conv1:caio_morgant_conv2|Caio is the stupidest man I have ever met. He is always asking about the most basic things. He knows nothing about tactics, and his ignorance puts all of us in danger.
; dlga_caio_morgant_conv2:caio_morgant_conv3|Excuse me if I have offended you. I just wanted to know what a cuenus is.
; dlga_caio_morgant_conv3:caio_morgant_conv4|--He is angrier and begins to speak louder--^^Don't you know?
; dlga_caio_morgant_conv4:caio_morgant_conv5|You have to be patient with Caio. He is a valuable man and learns fast.
; dlga_caio_morgant_conv4:caio_morgant_conv6|Caio, if you don't come up to scratch soon, you should consider leaving us.
; dlga_caio_morgant_conv4:close_window|Don't bother me with this foolishness again.
; dlga_caio_morgant_conv5:close_window|Thank you for your confidence.
; dlga_caio_morgant_conv6:close_window|I... understand.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:brunhild_conversationcamp1|Sometimes when I sleep, I dream of my past life in Doccinga and Kennemer. These nightmares remind me of my time of servitude.
; dlga_brunhild_conversationcamp1:brunhild_conversationcamp2|I am glad that I have left all that behind. In fact, I hate Friese, and treading its soil brings back dark memories. When we visit Friese on our travels, I only ask you to have patience with me. I will spend most of the time in my tent when we are not walking or fighting, sulking and not wanting to talk to anyone.
; dlga_brunhild_conversationcamp2:close_window|Now, forgive me, but just talking about it has upset my stomach. I think all these memories make me so depressed that I may never fully heal.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:bodo_conversationcamp1|--You note that he is impatient, nervous.--^^Hi {playername}. We've been traveling together for a while, and our friendship, at least for me, is sincere. In fact, I have not trusted anyone like this for years.
; dlga_bodo_conversationcamp1:bodo_conversationcamp2|Actually, I'm surprised that our relationship is so good. My life has not been easy, especially here in the north, and I find it hard to trust people, but you're winning my trust so easily, it scares me.
; dlga_bodo_conversationcamp2:bodo_conversationcamp3|It's good to trust others, Bodo.
; dlga_bodo_conversationcamp2:bodo_conversationcamp3_2|That has happened to me as well.
; dlga_bodo_conversationcamp2:bodo_conversationcamp4|Keep your distance. You're just a soldier to me.
; dlga_bodo_conversationcamp3:close_window|Yes, you're right. I should trust myself more. Friendship is normal, not a dangerous shackle. Thanks my friend!
; dlga_bodo_conversationcamp3_2:close_window|You feel it, too? You see? We are suspicious people, too used to danger and to being deceived. I'll think about it! Thanks for your time.
; dlga_bodo_conversationcamp4:close_window|Yes, sorry. I was confused, but you've certainly cleared it up for me.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:bodo_2conversationcamp1|{playername}, we have to talk! It is complicated. I do not know how to say this, but it needs to be said.
; dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp1:bodo_2conversationcamp2|Let me be clear, I've noticed how you look at me, and I fear that you're falling for me. I completely understand. I am an attractive man with warrior skills and leadership, but I must warn you that I am a married. I have a woman there in Cantabria and sixteen children.
; dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp2:bodo_2conversationcamp3|I think you should stop experimenting with mushrooms, Bodo. I have no interest in you.
; dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp2:bodo_2conversationcamp3_2|It's true. I really like you.
; dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp2:bodo_2conversationcamp4|Keep your distance, sir. You're a lowly soldier! I hardly even notice your presence.
; dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp3:close_window|Are you sure? That surprises me, I'm a real man, really macho, who attracts a lot of women. Well, luckily, now I can breathe easier.
; dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp3_2:bodo_2conversationcamp5|That worries me. You're an attractive woman, but you must know that I'm a married man and I owe it to my wife. I must make it clear that nothing will ever happen between us.
; dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp4:close_window|Yes, sorry. I was confused, but you've certainly cleared it up for me.
; dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp5:close_window|I was joking. I do not really like you. You're an ugly pig.
; dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp5:close_window.1|Do not worry. From now on, our relationship will strictly be that of warlord and soldier.
; dlga_bodo_2conversationcamp5:close_window.2|No problem, but I will keep your name on my wish list.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:solveig_conversationcamp1|For the first time in my life, I feel like I am in a real army. Being a warrior and being beautiful have never made it easy for me to be part of a large group of men, but here you know how to maintain order, and people respect me.
; dlga_solveig_conversationcamp1:solveig_conversationcamp2|The Danish and Norwegians, and the world in general, do not have a good opinion of a woman who leaves home armed and ready to fight. Exactly for this reason, the skjaldmo are more legend than reality. There are very few like me, and soon there will be none, believe me.
; dlga_solveig_conversationcamp2:solveig_conversationcamp3|In my army, we do not distinguish between men and women, only between good and bad warriors.
; dlga_solveig_conversationcamp2:solveig_conversationcamp3_2|You will always be well treated here.
; dlga_solveig_conversationcamp2:solveig_conversationcamp4|Woman, your place is at home with a husband.
; dlga_solveig_conversationcamp3:close_window|I know, and I like it here. You must know that you have a loyal follower in me. I am committed to your cause.
; dlga_solveig_conversationcamp3_2:close_window|Thanks, {playername}. I hope to stay with you for a long time.
; dlga_solveig_conversationcamp4:close_window|I am confused. On the one hand, you accept me in your army, but on the other hand, you say I should get married and go home. You must be joking. Hah! Good one on old Solveig.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:solveig_2conversationcamp1|{playername}, I like you a lot. I must admit that I am drawn to you.
; dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp1:solveig_2conversationcamp2|As you know, I chose the path of war. I keep my virginity in order to protect myself from love and men. It is not an easy way; it's not a comfortable way, but it has its laws, and if I break these, my life will become meaningless. My arms are my only husbands, and my shield is my home. I need you to respect that or I'll have to leave your company.
; dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp2:solveig_2conversationcamp3|I respect that, Solveig, and I am not really attracted to you.
; dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp2:solveig_2conversationcamp4|Sorry, Solveig, but I'm in love with you.
; dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp3:close_window|Well, part of me regrets that my feelings are not reciprocated, but the other part is happy to continue serving under your banner. I need to analyze these feelings. Good luck, friend.
; dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp4:solveig_2conversationcamp5|I understand. We love each other, but we can't be together. If I give in to this, I will end up locked away on a farm looking after 10 kids, and I could not bear that. I was born to be free and live an intense life. I want to enjoy the same freedoms as a man. I think it would be the best if I leave.
; dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp5:solveig_2conversationcamp6|Don't leave, Solveig. We will never discuss this again, and I shall restrain myself.
; dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp5:solveig_2conversationcamp7|Yes, it is best that you leave.
; dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp6:close_window|I also want to stay. Let's not talk about it and keep our distance. From now on, I will put my tent as far away from yours as possible. Farewell.
; dlga_solveig_2conversationcamp7:close_window|Yes, I think that is most appropriate. Good luck, friend. May the fates accept you.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:asbjorn_conversationcamp1|It's interesting how Christian priests speak about the end of the world. It is very similar to what the Danish think. In both cases, we do not know when it will come, but we're sure it will. In both cases, it will be a catastrophe of epic proportions and of huge armies fighting in a devastated world.
; dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp1:asbjorn_conversationcamp2|But they think differently about other things. For the Danish, a large tree, called Yggdrasil, holds the nine worlds. The principal world is Asgard, where the gods live and which is governed by Odin and his wife Frigg. It can only be reached by the Rainbow Bridge, named Bifrost and guarded by Heimdal.
dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp2:asbjorn_conversationcamp3|Dimmi di più.
; dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp2:close_window|Very interesting, but I have no time to listen. Farewell.
; dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp3:asbjorn_conversationcamp4|Another world is the ice land of Jotunheim, where a giant lives, banished there by our gods, the Aesir. There are also Alfheim, home of the elves, and Svartalfaheim, inhabited by dark elves and dwarves. We are in Midgard, the Middle Earth, inhabited by men. Below is the dark world of Niflheim, inhabited by the dragon Nidhogg, who has been gnawing at the roots of Yggdrasil from the beginning of time. Someday the roots will all be eaten and Yggdrasil will fall, starting Ragnarok. 
dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp4:asbjorn_conversationcamp5|Dimmi di più.
; dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp4:close_window|Very interesting, but I have no time to listen. Farewell.
; dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp5:asbjorn_conversationcamp6|At the end of time, Loki, his monsters and the dead will advance on the other worlds. Heimdall will sound his horn from the Rainbow Bridge, and gods and men will tremble with fear, for they will know that their time has come. A battle of gigantic proportions, the Ragnarok, will occur in which the gods and men will clash against the hosts of evil. The gods will lose, because it is well predicted, and their world will be destroyed by chaos. Odin will be swallowed up by the wolf Fenrir. 
; dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp6:asbjorn_conversationcamp7|Well, {playername}, I guess it's not a very promising fate, but it teaches us that, no matter what we do, we are doomed. Therefore, it is best to enjoy each new day thoroughly.
; dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp7:close_window|Fate is inexorable, Asbjorn.
; dlga_asbjorn_conversationcamp7:close_window.1|I make my own destiny, Asbjorn.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:helgi_conversationcamp1|{playername}, as you know, a long time ago I was in the land of Rus in the east. I travelled all through the far lands of the Slavs. I had good boots and became rich, until fate twisted things and brought me west.
; dlga_helgi_conversationcamp1:helgi_conversationcamp2|What I didn't tell you is that I suffered for love. I fell in love with the wife of a jarl, and she fell in love with me. We kept our love a secret, but someone betrayed us. The jarl killed his wife and put a price on my head, but I did not flee...
dlga_helgi_conversationcamp2:helgi_conversationcamp4|Sto ascoltando.
; dlga_helgi_conversationcamp2:close_window|No more talking. You have to keep your hands off other people's wives.
; dlga_helgi_conversationcamp4:helgi_conversationcamp5|I painted my face black and dressed in dark clothes. That night, I broke into his farm and killed him in his sleep. Then I fled to the west, where nobody knew me. Although everything I told you before was true, this is the real reason I'm here with you today. However, I have discovered that you are a great leader that I like to follow.
; dlga_helgi_conversationcamp5:close_window|Thank you for your honesty.
; dlga_helgi_conversationcamp5:close_window.1|Nice story, but you have to keep your hands off other people's wives.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:helgiromance_conversationcamp1|After the death of Helgi, the woman I was in love with, I thought it was impossible to fall in love again, {playername}.
; dlga_helgiromance_conversationcamp1:helgiromance_conversationcamp3|I think the old wound has finally healed, and I'm ready for a new relationship.
; dlga_helgiromance_conversationcamp3:helgiromance_conversationcamp4|I am happy to hear that.
; dlga_helgiromance_conversationcamp3:close_window|Well, we will see if your fight better in the shield wall now.
; dlga_helgiromance_conversationcamp4:close_window|I'm glad to hear that you are happy about it.
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:helgiromance2_conversationcamp1|I need to talk, {playername}. It is a very serious issue for me, but I will only raise it once.
; dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp1:helgiromance2_conversationcamp3|You know, I'm interested in you, appreciate you and like you. I think you feel the same way when you look at me, but I'm not sure.
; dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp3:helgiromance2_conversationcamp4|Yes, Helgi, I like you a lot.

; dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp4:helgiromance2_conversationcamp5|I am happy to hear you say that! After Helgi's death, I did not think I could fall in love again, but here we are. I think we will be fine.

; dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp5:helgiromance2_conversationcamp6|Yes, we can be together, but please stop mentioning Helgi.
; dlga_helgiromance2_conversationcamp5:helgiromance2_conversationcamp7|No. It was just a joke. I'm not interested in you at all.

; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:agathinos_conversationcamp1|Salve {playername}! My friend and I were just talking about you. We were discussing whether you're just a warlord or if you have ambitions of being Brytenwalda. Oh, sorry to be rude. Here, please meet Heraclio.
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp1:agathinos_conversationcamp2|--Agathinos changes his voice, making it sharp--^^Salve {playername}, I am Heraclio from Nicea.
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp2:agathinos_conversationcamp3|Agathinos, what does this mean?
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp2:agathinos_conversationcamp3.1|Salve Heraclio.
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp2:close_window|Have you been eating mushrooms again? Maybe you need some sleep.
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp3:agathinos_conversationcamp4|Heraclio is spending a few days with us before returning to Nicea. I haven't seen him for a very long time -- not since those painful, torturous days as slaves of the Norwegians. He will leave soon, but he wanted to meet you before he goes.
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp4:agathinos_conversationcamp5|It's high time I finally met you, Heraclio.
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp4:close_window|I have no time for this. Farewell.
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp5:agathinos_conversationcamp6|--Agathinos changes his voice, making it sharp--^^My brother from another mother, the illustrious engineer Agathinos, has told me a lot about you. He thinks you'll be Brytenwalda, but I think that you're just a warlord.
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp6:agathinos_conversationcamp7|Agathinos is right. I will be Brytenwalda someday.
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp6:agathinos_conversationcamp7.1|You are right. I am simply a man of war.
; dlga_agathinos_conversationcamp7:close_window|--Before your eyes, Agathinos starts arguing with himself, changing his voice and without paying much attention to you.--
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:brunhildvsegil_conv1|Are you serious, Egil? Did you really make out with a camp follower? I thought you were different and that you really cared about us, but now I see I was wrong. You are just a bastard in every meaning.
; dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv1:brunhildvsegil_conv2|Brunhild, Honey, you are just a slave and I'm the son of the king. Our story can't be real. We were just having fun, nothing else. I thought you knew that. You would have to be an idiot to think you can have a king's son just like that. You will always be my favourite, but I have and I will always have my good times with others... Who knows? Maybe someday I will find a lady to marry.
; dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv2:brunhildvsegil_conv3|Calm down!
; dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv2:brunhildvsegil_conv3.1|(Say nothing)
; dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv3:brunhildvsegil_conv4|Do you really think that? You are not so superior to me. Your father might be a king, but your mother was nothing but a slave, like me. You will never get anyone better than me, and you will lose me if your attitude doesn't change.
; dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv4:brunhildvsegil_conv5|I don't need to be officially recognised as an heir. Everyone knows that I'm the son of the king of Danmark. Every single lady in the kingdom sighs for me. Don't get me wrong, I love you and I really like what we have, but I can have so much more.
; dlga_brunhildvsegil_conv5:close_window|...^^--Nothing to do here. You run while you can.--
; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:clovisvshegil_conv1|You people think that strong arms can win any battle, but it's not always the case. A good formation or a smart strategy is much more important than bold warriors. Even in a duel, the strength of a soldier is not the key factor that makes him win or lose.
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv1:clovisvshegil_conv2|That is what you weak people always think, and that's why we, the bravest soldiers of all Svia, or even just simple Danes, pillage your lands. If you spent more time training and becoming good warriors instead of dancing around one another, you would have a real kingdom instead of those tiny lands you have in Frankia... for now.
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv2:clovisvshegil_conv3|Try to come openly, without any surprises, and we'll see what happens. I swear that your undisciplined men will fall in a few moments and that none of you would survive, because you don't know when one needs to retreat.
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv3:clovisvshegil_conv4|Ha! Cowards! We prefer to be brave and dead instead of being shamed as losers. Victory or death!
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv4:clovisvshegil_conv5|Frankia makes better warriors than Svia.
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv4:clovisvshegil_conv5_2|Svia makes better warriors than Frankia.
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv4:clovisvshegil_conv5_3|I think you both are wrong. A good army needs both strict discipline and strong warriors.
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv5:clovisvshegil_conv6|Ha! The Warlord thinks like me.
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv6:close_window|I'll spare further words.
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv5_2:clovisvshegil_conv6_2|Exactly. Ha!
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv6_2:close_window|Who was asking? I thought this was a private discussion.
; dlga_clovisvshegil_conv5_3:clovisvshegil_conv6_3|...

; dlga_conversation_companioncamp:bedavsagathinos_conv1|--Agathinos stares with great interest at one of the women from the camp...--

; dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv2:bedavsagathinos_conv3|--Spits on the ground.--^^The Greeks are lustful people.
; dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv3:bedavsagathinos_conv4|What makes you think so?
; dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv4:bedavsagathinos_conv5|Even your priests live in sin. The Council of Elvira forbade clerics to cohabit with their wives. Otherwise, how can they celebrate the daily Eucharist? If they yield to the temptation of the flesh, what you can expect from their flock?
; dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv5:bedavsagathinos_conv6|Do not confuse celibacy with continence. The Council of Elvira did not forbid marriage to the clergy, just the sharing of a bed before sacred offices.
; dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv6:bedavsagathinos_conv7|Sex is a carnal act. That takes us away from the path of Christ. Virginity is an obligation for any true man of God. Am I not right, {playername}?
; dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv7:bedavsagathinos_conv8|I agree with you, Bede. These people have to be perverts.
; dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv7:bedavsagathinos_conv9|And what's wrong with sex? I know priests with more children than Noah.
; dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv7:bedavsagathinos_conv10|I don't want to get involved. This is an argument between you and Agathinos.
; dlga_bedavsagathinos_conv8:close_window|Well said. You step fully and still in the kingdom of heaven.

; dlga_start:fighter_talk|Hello there. We are polishing off our combat skills here with a bit of sparring practice. You look like you could use a bit of training. Why don't you join us, and we can show you a few tricks. If you need explanation of any combat concepts, just ask, and I will do my best to fill you in.
dlga_start:fighter_talk.1|In cosa volete fare pratica?
dlga_fighter_pretalk:fighter_talk|Ditemi, in cosa volete addestrarvi?
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_attack|Voglio addestrarmi nelle tecniche d'attacco.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_parry|Voglio addestrarmi nelle parate all'arma bianca.
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_combat|Voglio fare un po' di pratica di combattimento.
dlga_fighter_talk:close_window|[Abbandona]
; dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack:fighter_talk_train_attack_2|All right. There are four principle directions for attacking. These are overhead swing, right swing, left swing and thrust. Now, I will tell you which direction to attack from and you must try to do the correct attack.^^(Move your mouse while you press the left mouse button to specify attack direction. For example, to execute an overhead attack, move the mouse up at the instant you press the left mouse button. The icons on your screen will help you do the correct action.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:close_window|Cominciamo allora. Posso iniziare.
; dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:fighter_pretalk|Actually, I want to do something else.
; dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry:fighter_talk_train_parry_2|Unlike a shield, blocking with a weapon can only stop attacks coming from one direction. For example if you block up, you'll deflect overhead attacks, but you can still be hit by side swings or thrust attacks.^^(You must press and hold down the right mouse button to block.)
; dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_2:fighter_talk_train_parry_3|I'll now attack you with different types of strokes, and I will wait until you do the correct block before attacking. Try to do the correct block as soon as you can.^^(This practice is easy to do with the 'automatic block direction' setting, which is the default. If you go to the Options menu and change the defend direction control to 'mouse movement' or 'keyboard,' you'll need to manually choose block direction. This is much more challenging, but makes the game much more interesting. This practice can be very useful if you use manual blocking.)
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:close_window|Cominciamo allora. Posso iniziare.
; dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:fighter_pretalk|Actually, I want to do something else.
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat:fighter_talk_train_combat_2a|La simulazione di combattimento è un ottimo modo per prepararsi al combattimento reale. Combatteremo tra noi con armi non letali, fino a quando uno dei due cade a terra. Potrete farvi qualche livido, ma è sempre meglio che avere la peggio in uno scontro reale.

dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again|Bene. Avete mostrato abilità nel bloccare i miei attacchi. Dovete ripetere quest'addestramento e provare a diventare sempre più veloce, fino a quando non acquisirete confidenza con le vostre abiltà difensive. Volete addestrarvi ancora?
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again.1|Non è andata molto bene, concordate? Volete provare di nuovo? (Ricorda, devi cliccare e tenere premuto il tasto destro del mouse per rendere la parata effettiva.)
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_train_parry|Si. Proviamo ancora.
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_parry|No, basta per adesso.
; dlga_start:fighter_parry_warn|Hey! We are practicing blocking, mate! You are supposed to block my attacks, not attack me back.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_train_parry|Scusatemi. Proviamo di nuovo.
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_leave_parry|Spiacente. Ora devo smettere.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_parry:close_window|Bene. Come desiderate.
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again|Non è andata molto bene, concordate? Non preoccupatevi, e provate a non commettere gli stessi errori la prossima volta. Volete continuare ad addestrarvi?
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_train_combat|Sì. Tentiamo nuovamente.
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_combat|No. È abbastanza per me.
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_combat:close_window|Va bene. Tornate da me se cambiate idea.
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again.1|Hey, è stato uno scontro valido. Mi avete sconfitto, la prossima volta però farò più attenzione. Volete fare un altro giro?
; dlga_start:fighter_talk.2|Very good. You have learned how to attack from any direction you want. If you like, we can try this again or move to a different exercise.
; dlga_start:archer_challenge_2|Not bad. Not bad at all! You seem to have grasped the basics of archery. Now, try to do the same thing with a sling. Take the sling and the sling rocks over there and shoot those three targets. The sling is much easier to use with compared with the bow, but you need to reload it after each shot.
; dlga_start:archer_challenge_2.1|Good. You didn't have too much difficulty using the sling either. Next, you will learn to use throwing weapons. Pick up the javelins you see over there and try to hit those three targets. 
; dlga_start:ranged_end2|Train every day, and in time, you will be as good as the best marksmen.
; dlga_ranged_end2:close_window|You can go talk with the melee fighters or the horsemanship trainer if you haven't already done so. They can teach you important skills too.
; dlga_start:ranged_end|Well, with that you have received the basic skills to use all three types of ranged weapons. The rest will come with practice. Train every day, and in time, you will be as good as the best marksmen.
; dlga_ranged_end:close_window|Now you can go talk with the melee fighters or the horsemanship trainer if you haven't already done so. They can teach you important skills too.
; dlga_start:archer_talk2|Good day to you, young fellow. I spend my days training the men of the jarl of Kennemer in the art of archery. If you need a bow and javelins to practice, let me know, and I'll rent them to you both for 10 peningas.
; dlga_archer_talk2:archer_challenge2|Yes, I wish to practice my archery with your men (pay 10 peningas).
dlga_archer_talk2:close_window|No, non ora.
; dlga_archer_challenge2:close_window|Nice to do business with you.
; dlga_start:archer_talk|Good day to you, young fellow. I spend my days teaching about ranged weapons to anyone that is willing to learn. If you need a tutor, let me know and I'll teach you how to use the bow, the sling and the javelin.
dlga_archer_talk:archer_challenge|Si, mostratemi come usare le armi da lancio.
dlga_archer_talk:close_window|No, non ora.
; dlga_archer_challenge:archer_challenge_2|All right. Your first training will be in archery. The bow is a difficult weapon to master, but once you are sufficiently good at it, you will be able to shoot quickly and with great power. Go pick up the bow and arrows you see over there now and shoot those targets.
; dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window|All right, I am ready.
; dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window.1|Wait just a moment. I want to do something else first.
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2|Spero che vi piaccia cavalcare. Ora passiamo a qualcosa di un po' più difficile. Afferrate la lancia che vedete là sopra e cavalcate lungo il percorso colpendo i bersagli allo stesso tempo.
; dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2.1|Good! You have been able to hit all targets on horseback. That's no easy feat for a starter. Your next challenge will be using a bow and arrows to shoot at the archery targets by the road. You need to put an arrow to each target to consider yourself successful.
; dlga_start:horsemanship_end2|You were good. Keep riding and practicing each day, and in time, you will be an expert horseman.
; dlga_horsemanship_end2:close_window|Now, you can go talk with the melee fighters or the archery trainer, if you haven't already done so. You need to learn everything you can to be prepared when you have to defend yourself.
; dlga_start:horsemanship_end|Keep riding and practicing each day, and in time, you will be an expert horseman.
; dlga_horsemanship_end:close_window|You can also go talk with the melee fighters or the archery trainer, if you haven't already done so. You need to learn everything you can to be prepared when you have to defend yourself.
; dlga_start:horseman_talk2|Good day! I have come here for some riding practice, but my old bones are aching badly, so I decided to give myself a rest today. If you would like to practice your horsemanship, you can take my horse here. The exercise would be good for her.
; dlga_horseman_talk2:horseman_challenge2|Yes, thank you for lending me your horse.
dlga_horseman_talk2:close_window|No, non ora.
; dlga_horseman_challenge2:close_window|No problem. Good luck.
dlga_start:horseman_talk|Buongiorno. Sono arrivato qui per fare della pratica d'equitazione, ma le mie vecchie ossa sono doloranti, così ho deciso per oggi di riposarmi. Se volete migliorare le vostre capacità nel cavalcare, potete prendere il mio cavallo. L'esercizio farà bene anche a lui.
dlga_horseman_talk:horseman_challenge|Si, voglio fare pratica d'equitazione.
; dlga_horseman_talk:close_window|Um, maybe later.
dlga_horseman_challenge:horseman_melee_challenge_2|Bene. Ora farete qualche esercizio che v'insegnerà a cavalcare e ad usare armi a cavallo. Il vostro primo compito è semplice. Prendete il cavallo per un giro intorno al circuito. Andate lentamente o velocemente, come preferite. Tornate quando avrete preso confidenza con l'uso del cavallo e vi darò altri esercizi da fare.
; dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window|All right, I am ready.
; dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window.1|Just a moment. I need to do something else first.
; dlga_tutorial_troop_default:close_window|Hey, I am trying to practice here. Go and talk with the archery trainer if you need guidance about ranged weapons.
dlga_start:lord_prison_break_confirm_3|C'è un cambiamento nei piani?
dlga_start:lord_prison_break|Che sta succedendo?
dlga_start:comp_prison_break|Che sta succedendo?
dlga_comp_prison_break:comp_prison_break1|Sono venuto a portarvi fuori da qui.
; dlga_comp_prison_break:comp_prison_break1a|You are free to rejoin my party, friend.
dlga_comp_prison_break1:close_window|Grazie al cielo siete qui! Tuttavia non posso andare da nessuna parte con queste catene alle gambe. Dovrete trovare un modo per portar via le chiavi alla guardia.
; dlga_comp_prison_break1a:close_window|Thank the heavens you came! Let me get my things collected, and I will rejoin you as soon as I can.
dlga_start:drunk_response|Che state guardando?
dlga_start:drunk_response.1|State guardando me?
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window|Un tale spreco...
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window.1|Meglio lui di me
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start|Non so con certezza... Qualche tipo di animale, chiaramente.
; dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start.1|Excuse me. Please accept my apologies
dlga_drunk_fight_start:close_window|Cancellerò quel sorriso dalla vostra faccia!
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_player_high_renown|Avete idea di chi io sia?
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start|Mi dovrebbe importare?
; dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_player_high_renown|Emmm... Actually... Yes, yes, I do know who you are, my {reg59?lady:lord}. Please forgive me, your grace -- it must be the drink. I'll be leaving, now...
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start.1|Perché... Se volete uno scontro, l'avrete!
; dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:close_window|I thought as much. Now, remove yourself from here.
; dlga_start:fistfight_response|You look like a {reg59?lady:fellow} who can take a few hard knocks -- and deal them out, too. I have a business proposition for you.
dlga_fistfight_response:fistfight_response_2|Di che si tratta?
dlga_fistfight_response_2:fistfight_response_2a|Bene, sono contento che v'interessi. Ecco il piano... È un po' complicato, quindi ascoltate attentamente...
; dlga_fistfight_response_2a:fistfight_response_3|You and this other fellow will start up a fight here. No weapons, no armor -- I'll sit back and take bets, and split the profits with the winner. If we make a loss, then I'll cover it. You have nothing to lose -- except a bit of blood, of course.
; dlga_fistfight_response_3:fistfight_response_4|However, we can't organize this like one of those nice arena bouts, where everyone places their bets beforehand. People will walk in, drawn by the noise, and put a pening or two on whichever one of your two they think is winning. I'll give 'em even odds -- anything else is going to be too tricky for someone who's already on his third flagon of ale.
; dlga_fistfight_response_4:fistfight_response_4a|So, as you can see, the trick is to stretch things out for as long as possible where it looks like you're losing, and people bet against you -- and then come back fast, and win, before the betting can turn. The best way to make money is for you to be battered almost to the floor, and then jump back off your feet and take your opponent down. However, you have to win in the end, in order for me, and you, to make money. 
; dlga_fistfight_response_4a:fistfight_response_5|Moreover, you can't stretch the fight out too long, or people will suspect a fix. So, one of you has to take a punch every so often. I don't care whose blood is spilled, but there has to be some blood.
; dlga_fistfight_response_5:fistfight_response_5a|One more thing. My mate, your opponent, doesn't take to well to complexity, so he's just going to come straight at you. It's up to you to supply the artistry.
dlga_fistfight_response_5a:fistfight_response_confirm|Allora, che ne pensate?
dlga_fistfight_response_confirm:close_window.1|Ho cose migliori da fare.

; dlga_start:ramun_introduce_1|Good day to you, {reg59?lassie:young man}.
; dlga_ramun_introduce_1:ramun_introduce_2|Forgive me. You look like a trader, but I see no merchandise.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:close_window|Niente.
dlga_ramun_introduce_2:ramun_introduce_3|Un Mercante? Oh, certo, io lo sono di sicuro. La mia mercanzia è differente da quella comune, comunque. Dev'essere alimentata e abbeverata due volte al giorno e cerca di scappare se gli volgo la schiena.
dlga_ramun_introduce_3:ramun_introduce_4|Merce viva?
dlga_ramun_introduce_4:ramun_introduce_5|Non siete distante dal vero. Mi piace chiamarmi 'l'uomo che tiene ogni barca su questo oceano in movimento'. Le barche sono guidate da remi, come sapete, ed i remi hanno bisogno di uomini per muoverle o arrestarle. Ecco dove arrivo io.
dlga_ramun_introduce_5:ramun_introduce_6|Schiavi per galee...
dlga_ramun_introduce_6:ramun_introduce_7|Ecco! Un porto commerciale non può sopravvivere senza di loro. Le galee perdono molte braccia in ogni viaggio, così c'è sempre un'alta richiesta. I capitani vengono da me e mi pagano bene.
dlga_ramun_introduce_7:ramun_introduce_8|Da dove vengono gli schiavi?
; dlga_ramun_introduce_8:ramun_introduce_9|Mostly I deal in convicted criminals bought from the authorities. Others are prisoners of war from various nations, or people unable to pay their debts, brought to me because I offer the best prices. However, on occasion I'll buy from privateers and other...

; dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners|I've brought you some prisoners. Would you like a look?
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Vediamo cos'avete...
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|È un piacere fare affari con Vostra Signoria.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing|Come posso prendere prigionieri?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing.1|Mi potete dire come catturare alcuni prigionieri?
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_have_blunt_weapon|You're new to this, aren't you? Let me explain it in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? I'm assuming you have a blunt weapon with you...
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Certo.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no|Purtroppo no...
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Bene, in termini più crudi l'unica cosa da fare è schiacciare questi insetti, e quando la battaglia è vinta potrete metterli in manette. È leggermente differente per nobili e comandanti: grazie alla loro abilità e alla pesante protezione che indossano rimarranno in vita anche se li colpirete con armi perforanti o da taglio.
; dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2|No? Heh, well, this must be your lucky day. I have an old club lying around that I was going to throw away. It's a bit battered, but still good enough to bash someone until he stops moving. Here, have it.
; dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Thanks, man. Perhaps I may try my hand at it.
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Alright, I'll try and explain it again in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_2:ramun_ask_about_capturing_3|Ok, penso di aver capito. Qualcos'altro?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_3:ramun_ask_about_capturing_4|Beh, tenete conto che non è una cosa semplice da fare. Le armi contundenti non fanno gli stessi danni di quelle taglienti, così non tireranno giù i nemici con la stessa velocità. E fidatevi, molte carogne che incontrerete vorranno uccidervi appena vi vedranno, quindi non aspettatevi alcuna cortesia particolare estraendo una clava anzichè una spada. Oltretutto, avendo dei prigionieri con vossignoria, rallenterete il vostro viaggiare, ecco perché alcuni liberano i prigionieri dopo che la battaglia ha avuto termine. È follia! Come può una persona gettare tutto quel denaro, eh?
; dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_4:ramun_ask_about_capturing_5|Are you done?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_5:ramun_ask_about_capturing_7|Giusto un'ultima cosa. Controllare i prigionieri con sicurezza non è una cosa semplice da fare, si può dire che è una capacità a sè stante. Se volete catturare molti prigionieri, dovete provare ed imparare per conto vostro, o non potrete portare nemmeno un uomo presso di voi.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_7:ramun_pre_talk|Grazie, lo terrò a mente.
; dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_prisoners|Is there anything else I can do with my prisoners?
; dlga_ramun_ask_prisoners:ramun_pre_talk|If you are so inclined, you can interrogate your prisoners while camping, and offer them a chance to join your army. That of course will lower the morale of your army, and some prisoners will agree to join you just to run away back to their families. If you have a figure of authority among your prisoners, such as a Bandit Leader you can ask him to form a band out of your prisoners (you must have more than 50), and send them to raid one of your enemy's villages, or attack them directly in exchange for freedom. But the best way is always for you to sell your prisoners to me.

; dlga_nurse_talk2:nurse_talk3|Here you are. Now, speak!
; dlga_nurse_talk3:close_window|Thank you, your lordship. To be considered as a potential groom, you have to be a person of stature, a pledged vassal or a renowned warrior. At the very least, you should have as much renown as junior lords. Secondly, you must have good relations with the lady, and her father or guardian. Lastly, the most important component is chemistry. The chemistry between you and the lady will largely depend on your charisma, so being ugly, fat, or having a cheap beer or pickle breath would hardly come handy. If you get refused the first time, don't despair, their ladyships are known for playing hard to get, wait a few days and try again. With high persuasion, and charisma, you will eventually prevail, and the lady will agree to get married. Then go and talk to her father or guardian, and get an official blessing from him.

That's one less thief to trouble our streets at night, although Heaven knows he won't be the last... Anyway, maybe you can help me with something. Let's talk more inside. Out here, we don't know who is listening.
dlga_start:merchant_quest_2a|Splendido lavoro. Avete raccolto abbastanza uomini da impiegare contro i banditi. Ora, dei viaggiatori arrivati a {s9} ci hanno detto che c'è un piccolo gruppo di briganti in agguato all'esterno della città. Io sospetto che facciano parte delle stessa banda, quella che ha preso mio fratello. Dategli la caccia e sconfiggeteli, fatevi anche rivelare la posizione del loro nascondiglio!
; dlga_start:merchant_quest_3a|So, you've found out where they hid my brother? Splendid work. I flatter myself that I'm a fine judge of character, and you look to be a {reg59?woman:man} who can get things done. Now, go out and save his unworthy hide!
; dlga_start:merchant_quest_3b|Well... My brother is home safe. I'm not sure what to do with him -- maybe pack him off to a university outside the Northlands. That way, if he gets knocked on the head in a street brawl, no one can say it's my fault. But that's not your problem. Here's the rest of your reward. It was well earned.
dlga_merchant_quest_3b:merchant_quest_4a|Questo denaro è benvenuto, e io sono felice di avervi potuto aiutare.
dlga_merchant_quest_4a:merchant_quest_4b|Ottimo! Ora... Desiderate fare qualcos'altro?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b:merchant_quest_4b1|Forse. Di cos'avete bisogno?
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b1:merchant_quest_4b2|Remember how I told you that the bandits had an ally inside the walls? I think I know who it is -- the captain of the watch, no less. Some months ago, this captain, seeing the amount of profit we merchants were making from trade across the frontiers, decided to borrow some money to sponsor a caravan. Unfortunately, like many who are new to commerce, he failed to realize that great profit only comes with great risk. So he sank all his money into the most expensive commodities, and of course, his caravan was captured and looted, and he lost everything.
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b2:merchant_quest_4b3|As a consequence, it seems, our captain turned to villainy to recoup his fortune. I supposed I'd do the same if, the Heavens forbid, I ever faced indebtedness and ruination. Now, any watch captain worth his salary will have a few thieves and robbers on his payroll, to inform on the rest, but our captain decides to employ these bastards wholesale. He brings them into the town, lets them do as they will, and takes a share of their take. You've heard of poachers turning gamekeepers? Well, in the unfortunate land of the Northlands, sometimes gamekeepers will turn poacher. Luckily, there are still a few brave, honest souls in the watch who've told me how he works.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b3:merchant_quest_4b4|Ecco il mio piano. Potrei portare la situazione all'attenzione di {s4}, signore della città, ma ciò significherebbe un'indagine, sarebbe solo la mia parola contro quella del Capitano, e i testimoni possono essere corrotti... Le prove distrutte, forse il tutto sarà dimenticato se il nemico si rifugia nuovamente oltre il confine, e tutto quello che otterrei sarebbe un coltello tra le costole. In tempo di guerra, voi lo sapete, gli occhi di un Re guardano lontano dal suo dominio, e i suoi sudditi soffrono. Per questo ho avuto un'altra idea. Ho messo insieme un piccolo gruppo di cittadini, alcuni sono miei lavoratori, altri hanno perso dei familiari a causa di questi banditi; porteremo la tempesta a casa del capitano e lo metteremo in catene prima di {s4}, se possibile catturando anche qualche bandito che possa testimoniare come stanno le cose.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b4:merchant_quest_4b5|Quello di cui ora ho bisogno è qualcuno che guidi la mia piccola armata in battaglia, e non posso pensare a nessuno migliore di voi. Allora cosa ne dite?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b5:merchant_quest_4b6|Come faccio a sapere che mi state dicendo la verità?
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b6:merchant_quest_4b7|Oh, well, I suppose it's possible that I found a dozen bandits who were willing to give their lives to give a passing stranger a false impression of life in old {s4}... Well, I guess you can't really know if my word is good, but I reckon you've learned by now that my money is good, and there's another 100 peningas, or maybe a bit more, that's waiting for you if you'll do me this last little favor. So what do you say?
; dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4b8|All right, I'll lead your men.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4_decline|Mi spiace. Sta avvenendo tutto troppo in fretta. Ho bisogno di tempo per pensarci.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b8:merchant_quest_4b9|Splendido. È passato molto tempo da quando ho scommesso tanto su un singolo tiro di dadi, e francamente lo trovo entusiasmante. I miei uomini sono pronti a muoversi sotto il vostro comando. Potete intraprendere quest'incarico?
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_accept|Si. Date loro il segnale.
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_decline|Non adesso. Ho bisogno di riposo prima di poter combattere di nuovo.
dlga_merchant_quest_4_accept:close_window|Ottimo! Ora... Colpite forte e velocemente, prima che il capitano e i suoi scagnozzi se ne rendano conto. Possa il cielo essere al vostro fianco!
dlga_merchant_quest_4_decline:close_window|D'accordo. Posso tener fermi i miei uomini ancora un po'. Se questa situazione dovesse andare per le lunghe, allora suppongo che dovrò portare a termine la faccenda senza di voi, ma sarei molto più contento se poteste essere al mio fianco. Detto questo, prendetevi il tempo che vi serve.
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window|Molto bene. Darò la caccia ai banditi.
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome|Perché non venite con noi?
dlga_merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome:merchant_quest_2a|Perché pago voi per farlo. Questa è la risposta breve. La risposta lunga è che ho degli affari da seguire qui in città e rischio molto più di voi di ritrovarmi con la testa fracassata, se lo volete sapere. Non fraintendetemi: la vostra domanda è tutt'altro che sciocca. Ora, cos'avete deciso?
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window.1|Non posso affrontare questa missione per adesso.

dlga_merchant_quest_3:merchant_quest_3a|Adesso andate e attaccate il nascondiglio di questi banditi, portate indietro mio fratello e mostrate a questi briganti cosa succede a chi minaccia la mia famiglia.
dlga_start:close_window.34|Oh -- grazie al cielo.. Grazie al cielo.. Sono in salvo ?
dlga_start:merchant_closing_statement_2|Ah... {playername}. Le cose non sono andate bene come speravo. {s5} non è riuscito a passar sopra alla mia piccola violazione del quieto vivere. Oh, egli è abbastanza grato che mi sia liberato del suo capitano corrotto, una guardia che fa entrare dei banditi farà passare un esercito nemico se il prezzo è giusto, ma non può proprio avermi qui in giro come un ricordo della sua incapacità di prendersi cura dei suoi compiti.
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_2:merchant_closing_statement_3|E' arduo trovare giustizia in questo..
; dlga_merchant_closing_statement_3:merchant_closing_statement_4|Fair? This is the Northlands, {reg59?my lady:my boy}! Kings do what they will, and the rest of us do as they must. He didn't string me up, and instead gave me time to sell my properties -- even put in a word with the other merchants that they best pay me a fair price, too. That's gracious enough, as kings go -- but he's a weak king, as they all are here, and weak kings must always look to their authority first, and justice second. I suppose I'd do the same, in his shoes.
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_4:close_window|Comunque, fossi in voi, non andrei a vantarmi della vostra parte in questa vicenda davanti a {s5}. Ho saputo che ha preso nota di voi e ha deciso che non meritate il disturbo d'impiccarvi. Questa è senz'altro una notizia a cui brinderei ogni giorno della settimana! Potrebbe anche avere del lavoro per voi; ma potreste sempre vendere la vostra spada ad uno dei suoi avversari, se temete ritorsioni. Comunque, spero che abbiate imparato che la vita in questa terra travagliata non è così facile come può sembrare, e se posso permettermi, ho il sospetto che il denaro che avete guadagnato non andrà sprecato. Buona fortuna, comandante. Che il cielo vi protegga.

I mean that I was her servant, her slave, when the Danish of Sven Bull Neck took me prisoner. Sven is terrible! I was afraid.

; dlga_companion_questions_beda4:companion_questions_beda5|{s2}^^I was the slave of your mother after the Danish captured me in East Engle little more than a month ago. She is not well, but that you already know. She is very ill; is dying. Most of the time, she does not remember who she is and says strange things. The Vikings of Sven Bull Neck think she is a seidr, someone who has spirits, and they consult her about their Fate. Sven has married her because that is believed to improve luck. He says that when he captures you, he will sacrifice you to the gods, because you have the blood of a seidr.
; dlga_companion_questions_beda5:companion_questions_beda61|I'm listening.
; dlga_companion_questions_beda5:companion_questions_beda62|I'm not interested in Sven. Tell me about my mother.
; dlga_companion_questions_beda61:companion_questions_beda62|Sven Bull Neck is a troubled man, and you have become his obsession for having killed his brother, a man named Olvir. Your mother predicted Olvir's death at your hands, and Sven is angry with his master, Sigurd Ragnarsson, as he was the one who sent Olvir to where you were.^^I've only known Sven a little. I heard the men say he was once a great leader, a shepherd of men. To the contrary, I saw a man who maintains loyalty through fear.
; dlga_companion_questions_beda62:companion_questions_beda63|Sometimes your mother could remember and be herself. Then she would speak about you, her {reg59?daughter:son}. She said that you were destined for greatness, and that your destiny is beyond the control of the Norns that sent Sven. Only she regrets that her end is near and that she will not see you.^^She told me to flee, to find you and remind you that the happiest day of her life was when you came into the world. She also told me that if she never sees you again, she would always be by your side.
; dlga_companion_questions_beda63:companion_questions_beda7|Where is she?
; dlga_companion_questions_beda63:companion_questions_beda7.1|She was always a weak woman. Where is Sven?
; dlga_companion_questions_beda7:companion_questions_beda8|When I escaped, we were close to Grantebrycge, but that was two weeks ago, which is what it took me to find you. The last I heard was that Sven Bull Neck gathered his men and led them to their ships to be at the service of the king.
; dlga_companion_questions_beda8:companion_questions_beda9|Is he going to Douar-an-Enez?
; dlga_companion_questions_beda8:companion_questions_beda92|I understand. I think I know where they went.
; dlga_companion_questions_beda9:companion_recruit_backstory_response|What? I have no idea who Douar is. Listen, I can't stay here. Your mother asked me to take care of you, so I'm going with you.
; dlga_companion_questions_beda92:companion_recruit_backstory_response|That is great! Listen. I can't remain here. Your mother asked me to take care of you, so I'm going with you.
; dlga_companion_recruit_backstory_responseasbjorn:companion_questions_asbjorn1|I've had to kill a companion and join a war fleet. Now I must take a judge along?

; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn2:companion_questions_asbjorn2_1|{s2}^^The Assembly decided I join you, but I am happy to carry it out. It is not my intention to control you, but I must ensure that you join the fleet and come to Englaland. From that moment on, I would like you to see me as a companion, as the doctor your men need.

; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn1:companion_questions_asbjorn3|{s2}^^I understand that things have not been easy, but the Assembly is the law. It is what keeps the balance in every part of Danmark and even in the whole kingdom. What do you think would have happened without the jurisdiction of the Assembly? Possibly a war between the King Horik and Jarl Sigurd? Who knows, this may still occur despite the Assembly. It would not be the first time. Honor and truth are very important in Danmark, and there are only two ways to satisfy their requirements: with wergild or blood. The line between friendship and hatred between two neighbors sharing the land is very thin. If the Assembly did not exist, hundreds of men would die every day for the slightest of complaints.
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn3:companion_questions_asbjorn4|The Assembly was not fair to me, whatever good there is in avoiding a war.
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn3:companion_questions_asbjorn6|That is fine. Let's get on track and join the Viking fleet.
; dlga_companion_questions_asbjorn4:companion_questions_asbjorn5|{s2}^^Assembly decisions cannot please everyone. Dare I say, sometimes the judgments of the Assembly are not meant to be fair.

; dlga_bodo_carta1:bodo_carta21|{s2}^^When you gave me to Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye,' I thought it was my end. I would die disgraced for having brought death to the Woden Ric and for not being able to fulfill the mission of my king. Fortunately for me, the letter of King Aldefonso was encrypted, so I'm still alive. The Vikings were not able to solve the mystery and brought me here to torture and tell them the code before the Assembly. The Vikings are not imaginative with torture, but they are brutal. I think if you had not come, I would not have endured much longer alive.

; dlga_bodo_carta4:bodo_carta35|Tell me about this letter, Bodo. Why is it so important?
; dlga_bodo_carta33:bodo_carta34|--The text is Latin, and it talks about Noah and his ark, with many comments by a monk, but nothing that would appear relevant.--
; dlga_bodo_carta35:bodo_carta34|This letter is important and can change everything, but I need your help to finish my mission. It's time to reveal its secrets...
; dlga_bodo_carta34:bodo_carta5|The trick is to read the first word after each period in the first three lines of each paragraph and read the last words before the period in the following.
; dlga_bodo_carta5:bodo_carta6|{s2}^^Aldefonso became king very recently, after inheriting the throne of his father. He explains at the beginning of this letter that he respects the North and continues the covenants of his father. He sends a messenger to West Seaxe -- me -- and another to Frankia. The North Sea, he says, should be made safe and the Vikings eradicated. West Seaxe is the best place from which to do this, given its proximity to Danmark.
; dlga_bodo_carta6:bodo_carta61|Why would the Kingdom of Asturias be worried about the Vikings?
; dlga_bodo_carta6:bodo_carta8|Get to the point, Bodo.
; dlga_bodo_carta61:bodo_carta7|{s2}^^My king, Aldefonso, is particularly concerned about the Danish, who are the ones who led the raids on his kingdom in the past. There were two particularly worrying attacks, which King Aldefonso does not want repeated. The first was about twenty-four years ago, during the reign of King Ranimiro, Aldefonso's grandfather, when the Vikings were seen near to Asturias coast with more than 120 ships and 3000 men. Ranimiro quickly gathered his men in Cantabria and Asturias and sent messages to come to Gallaecia, where the Vikings landed to cause damage. Ranimiro was a warrior king. When the Vikings arrived, he was firmly entrenched in a stronghold, so he was able to defeat them in battle and burn 70 ships.
; dlga_bodo_carta7:bodo_carta8|All the same, another big Viking expedition came ten years ago, in the time of King Ordonio, the father of the current king. The fleet of almost 100 ships was led by Bjorn Ironside and Haesten, Ragnar's sons. They disembarked in Gallaecia, near the tomb of Santiago, and caused much damage before they were expelled. After this King Ordonio began contacting other kingdoms in the North that had been attacked by Vikings, too, especially Frankia and West Seaxe. This letter is the finale to years of diplomatic efforts.
; dlga_bodo_carta8:bodo_carta9|The letter says that according to what was promised by his father, Aldefonso agrees to send 20 ships and 600 men to West Seaxe. The men are all veterans of the Muslim wars, fully equipped with chain mail, sword, spear and shield. These men, joining West Seaxe with contributions from Frankia, will cleanse the sea of Vikings. The letter details the route and the ports these men will use on their journey to West Seaxe and asks the very noble king, Aethelred of the Seaxna, to prepare accommodation and food for them. Do you see the importance of this letter, and why Sigurd Ragnarsson, or any Viking leader, for that matter, would want to intercept it?
; dlga_bodo_carta9:bodo_carta91|This alliance may harm the interests of the Danish and their way of life.
; dlga_bodo_carta9:bodo_carta92|Six hundred veteran men would allow West Seaxe to conquer other kingdoms.
; dlga_bodo_carta9:bodo_carta91.1|I'd rather you tell me.
; dlga_bodo_carta9:bodo_carta11|Honestly, I do not care. Now that we have the letter, it's time to go back to King Horik.
; dlga_bodo_carta92:bodo_carta91|No, you are not listening to me. This army is not to be used for conquering. It is an alliance with one objective: cleanse the North Sea of Vikings. Allow me to explain.
; dlga_bodo_carta91:bodo_carta10|Figure that 600 veteran men from each kingdom make 1800 soldiers whose sole purpose is to finish the Vikings. We're not talking about a peasant levy but about professional warriors, well trained and well equipped. This is a huge economic burden for any one kingdom, but if they are well led -- King Aethelred's brother, Aelfred, was chosen for this -- it could free the North Sea of the tempest that now whips it. Therefore, the letter is important to my mission, so Sigurd Ragnarsson made every effort to intercept it. If he can show the letter in the Assembly and so demonstrate the danger that it portends for all of them, the Assembly will make him king with the mission of preventing this alliance.
; dlga_bodo_carta10:bodo_carta11|Then I will give the letter to King Horik, so it will be he who will lead the Danish.
; dlga_bodo_carta10:bodo_carta13|Fine. In that case, I'll give the letter to West Seaxe.
; dlga_bodo_carta10:bodo_carta13.1|I need to see what the Assembly decides. Then I will decide. Save it for now.
; dlga_bodo_carta10:bodo_carta13.2|This letter is a powerful weapon. Keep it safe.
; dlga_bodo_carta11:bodo_carta12|If you give this letter to King Horik or any other Norseman, he will use it to gain power and then destroy all that my kings have fought for over the years. I understand that your concerns now are the Assembly and your mother. I'll help you with that now. Later we will discuss the letter again.
; dlga_bodo_carta12:bodo_carta13|Fine, but don't think I'll change my mind. I will certainly give it to the Vikings.
; dlga_bodo_carta12:bodo_carta13.1|Fine, but don't think I'll change my mind. I will certainly give it to West Seaxe.
; dlga_bodo_carta12:bodo_carta13.2|Fine, we'll talk about the letter later.
; dlga_bodo_carta13:bodo_carta14|Well, we will tell King Horik that the letter was destroyed during the fight with Atli Eiriksson. Then he does not have to worry about Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' using it in the Assembly. This will ensure his support for your cause.
; dlga_bodo_carta14:close_window|Let's not waste any more time but get out of this cave.
; dlga_brunhild_avisa:companion_brunhild_conv|Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' was in the mead hall of the jarl of Kennemer on more than one occasion. He is not just any man, my {reg59?lady:lord}! You know that the jarl of Kennemer is a hard man, but he trembled before Sigurd. Sigurd doesn't say a lot, he never smiles, and his snake eyes burrow into you as if he were trying to read your thoughts. I was but a slave, but I heard things. People say that he is the most dangerous of the sons of Ragnar, a man who would kill you just for coughing nearby or for being in his way on the wrong day.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv:companion_brunhild_conv3|The beautiful Brunhild is right, {playername}. From what I know, Sigurd Ragnarsson is the kind of man that one should avoid. Unfortunately, he blocks our way...
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv3:companion_brunhild_conv4|I don't believe it is so bad. You can't trust the jarl of Kennemer, since he is an accomplished actor who uses every possible tool to try to manipulate others. If he saw an advantage in passing as timid before Sigurd, he would've done that. I would be very careful with him, as he's a man who smiles when you face him, and stabs you with a dagger when you turn. With Sigurd, at least, you always know where he is coming from.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv4:companion_brunhild_conv5|Reginhard is talking without knowing him. I've heard things and seen things. Maybe Reginhard was too busy drinking or betraying someone. Sigurd is spiteful, never forgiving -- and never forgetting...
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv5:companion_brunhild_conv6|You have the gall, woman, to call me a drunk and traitor to my face! You know nothing about me! Watch your words, or you will have to watch your back.

; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv71:companion_brunhild_conv73|I'm sorry, my {reg59?lady:lord}. I'm sorry, Reginhard. I let my temper get the best of me.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv72:companion_brunhild_conv73|Yes, I see how things work now. I withdraw my threats, but she should watch her words.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv73:companion_brunhild_conv74|We are at crossroads. Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' has what we need, and your mother's life is in danger. In my opinion, we should go and talk to him, even if it costs us our lives. We have no choice...
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv74:companion_brunhild_conv75|Maybe there is another way. There is a powerful man who hates Sigurd: King Horik Gottfredsson of Danmark, Sigurd's king.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv75:companion_brunhild_conv76|Why does his king hate him, Brunhild?
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv75:companion_brunhild_conv8|Imagine what you propose. If you were to speak to King Horik, what would you say?
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv76:companion_brunhild_conv8|Well, I know only what I've heard. They are enemies. Maybe Sigurd wants to be king himself.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv8:companion_brunhild_conv9|Sigurd would be stupid, then. King Horik could banish him, make him an outcast, and strip him of his lands by denouncing him for the slightest infraction at the Thing.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv9:companion_brunhild_conv10|My knowledge is limited, but perhaps Sigurd is as powerful as the king himself. Or maybe King Horik doesn't want more wars in Danmark, after getting his throne after a long war with the other jarls.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv10:companion_brunhild_conv111|Reginhard, what is this 'thing' you speak of?
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv10:companion_brunhild_conv112|Speak with Sigurd or tell King Horik? We have a difficult decision to make.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv111:companion_brunhild_conv112|The Thing or the Assembly is a meeting of free men where disputes are solved and political decisions are made.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv112:companion_brunhild_conv12|I think we should get the protection and support of King Horik. This will give us an advantage when talking to Sigurd and will force him to respect our lives. If King Horik helps us, you can legally claim your mother back.
; dlga_companion_brunhild_conv12:companion_brunhild_conv13|Do not go straight to Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' now. It may cause the death of your mother, and perhaps you will lose track of Sven Bull Neck forever. Why not see whether King Horik will support us?

; dlga_companion_reginhard2:companion_reginhard3.3|You're such an interesting person. What is your story? (Persuasion)
dlga_companion_reginhard21:companion_reginhard2|{s2}
; dlga_companion_reginhard3:companion_reginhard4|{s2}^^When my family died, I joined the rebels, tough and brave men who struggle to free us from the oppression of the Danish. I fought at their side, and I was happy because being with them, always busy and fearing death, made me forget what happened to my family.
; dlga_companion_reginhard4:companion_reginhard41|Why are you no longer with them?
; dlga_companion_reginhard4:companion_reginhard42|What can you tell me about your leader?
; dlga_companion_reginhard4:companion_reginhard421|How can I find them?
; dlga_companion_reginhard421:companion_reginhard422|You cannot find them. They do not want to be found. These men fear the jarl. Thiaderd only allows people he trusts to join.
; dlga_companion_reginhard422:companion_reginhard423|I am trustworthy. Ask me anything you want.
; dlga_companion_reginhard422:companion_reginhard423.1|I think you're playing with me, and I do not like it. I'm leaving.
; dlga_companion_reginhard423:close_window|{s3}^^Look at me and listen. There are many people having a hard time during this rebellion, particularly the many widows and orphans. There is a woman in Dorestad who collects donations to care for these widows and orphans. Go see her and help. I think you're a good person, but show me. Talk to this woman. Her name is Adda. You can find her in the shop on the wharf. Make a donation in my name. Maybe this will help my people see me with different eyes.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside1:bodo_choiceside21|Bodo, remind me about your mission.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside1:bodo_choiceside22|Yes, I was thinking about the letter, and I've made a decision.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside21:bodo_choiceside22|Your memory is fragile, my friend. When we traveled in the Woden Ric, Sven Bull Neck attacked us to steal a letter that I had. That's where our history began. Sven stole the letter for Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye,' his jarl, but we recovered the letter in Northvegr. We pulled it from the hands of the corpse of Atli, the man whom Sigurd had ordered to protect the letter. Now the letter is in our possession, and we were waiting for the right time to take it to West Seaxe. This time has come.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside22:bodo_choiceside3|I am very happy! Without you, I would not have gotten this far. The letter will coordinate the alliance between West Seaxe, Asturias and the Franks. These three kingdoms will gather together men and ships to cleanse the North Sea of Vikings. In fact, it is possible that the fleet of Asturias is about to be sent, because my mission has been delayed.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside3:bodo_choiceside4_s|I would like to hear the opinions of my other companions before making a decision.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside3:bodo_choiceside4_1|Now, hear my decision.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside4_1:bodo_choiceside4_2|{playername}, I think you should listen to our opinion before deciding.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside4_2:bodo_choiceside4_s|Sure.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside4_2:bodo_choiceside9|No, I'm the leader and don't need your opinions.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside4_s:bodo_choiceside4|I have nothing to say. I will listen to the others.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside4_s:bodo_choiceside4.1|I submit to whatever {playername} chooses.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside4_s:bodo_choiceside4.2|--He clears his throat to get the attention of all.--
; dlga_bodo_choiceside4:bodo_choiceside41|Sorry, but I can't be impartial in this matter. My ancestors, my family, are Vikings. The gods have granted us victory upon victory, so that we may acquire fame and wealth.  This invasion we have embarked upon is in the footsteps of the sons of Ragnar in Englaland. It is a rich, fertile land worth fighting for. The Danish understand that if you can seize something, it's yours. It is for the inhabitants of the land to defend it and be worthy adversaries.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside41:bodo_choiceside42|The Danish are not beggars, and do not come asking for a piece of land. Danes do not ask for charity from the Saxons. We come with weapons in hand, ready to fight. If the Angles or Saxons defeat us, we will respect their victory, but if we prevail, the gods are with us and the fertile soil belongs to us. That is what I believe. If the Saxons and Franks come northward to fight and defeat the Danish, they are true warriors and the land is theirs.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside42:bodo_choiceside43|Your opinion will weigh heavily in my decision, Asbjorn. Thank you.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside42:bodo_choiceside43.1|This does not clarify anything.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside42:bodo_choiceside43.2|All men have the right to live without having to worry about what the sea may bring.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside43:bodo_choiceside5|I've said all I have to say. You have my support, whatever you decide. It doesn't matter anyway, as fate has already been written.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside43:bodo_choiceside5.1|Whatever you decide, I'm taking my leave and going back to Odinsve. I've made good friends in this party, but I know that now we'll be at odds. Therefore, I leave while we are still all friends.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside5:bodo_choiceside51|I am not as good as Asbjorn at speaking. I'm just a slave who escaped from the hands of a Danish jarl. You know what I think about the Danish, or rather certain Danes who occupy Kennemer. They come, kill and take what they want. If delivering the letter to West Seaxe means a safer North Sea, you have my support. If you deliver the letter to the Danish, on the other hand...
; dlga_bodo_choiceside51:bodo_choiceside6|Your opinion evens my decision, Brunhild.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside51:bodo_choiceside53|What? What would you do if I carry the letter to the Danish?
; dlga_bodo_choiceside53:bodo_choiceside6|I'll stay by your side, even though I do not like your decision. I owe you too much and have spent too much time with you to do otherwise.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside53:bodo_choiceside6.1|I will take another direction. I will not be part of what happens.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside6:bodo_choiceside7|Well... well I do not know what to say. I'm fine here. I think I'll stay with you, choose what you want.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside6:bodo_choiceside61|I'm not happy here. I'm sorry, but I must leave and find another person to follow.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside61:bodo_choiceside62|You are very important to this group, Agathinos. I want you to follow us.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside61:bodo_choiceside7|I see. We'll be better off without you.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside62:bodo_choiceside7|{s2}^^Great! Then I'll stay.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside7:bodo_choiceside71|It is my turn to speak. I have chosen you. I have followed you. I have fought beside you. Therefore, I think I know you better than most, {playername}. I am from Northvegr. We fought against the Danes often, and many other times we drank and laughed with them. They are like us: free men who choose to live out their fate. In Danmark or Northvegr, we have laws, but Englaland does not belong to anyone that matters. They are weak kingdoms with much wealth for the taking. You cannot put a treasure in plain sight of a man, not protect it and simply hope that he does not take it. If you're an idiot, why is it his fault?
; dlga_bodo_choiceside71:bodo_choiceside8|Strength and Chaos? I love your idea, too, Solveig.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside71:bodo_choiceside8.1|Rule by force is not fair and just brings chaos.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside8:bodo_choiceside9|Chaos is good. I'll keep at your side no matter what happens. Too many things unite us.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside8:bodo_choiceside9.1|Chaos is good. Sorry, but I don't fight against free men who have merely chosen to be Vikings.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside9:bodo_choiceside10|{s2}^^I'm worried about all this. I thought you were on my side. We were to go to the king of West Seaxe together, but now I do not know. I sense doubt...
; dlga_bodo_choiceside10:bodo_choiceside111|I have no doubt, Bodo. We will go together to the king of West Seaxe.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside10:bodo_choiceside112|I have decided to give the letter to Rathbarth and the rest of Ragnar's sons.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside111:bodo_choiceside13|{s2}^^I knew you would not fail me. Well, we must go to the king of West Seaxe as soon as possible!
; dlga_bodo_choiceside112:bodo_choiceside14|--His face goes from bewilderment to uncontrolled fury.--^^What? Traitor! I trusted you, I considered you a friend, a brother. Not only have you failed me, but you're encouraging our enemies. After all we've been through, Sigurd and Sven triumph. Well, I will not stay idle. Farewell, {playername}, and hope we do not meet again... for your sake.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside112:bodo_choiceside14.1|{s2}^^What? Traitor! I trusted you. We have our differences and do not always get along, but I thought you'd honor your word. Not only have you failed me, but you're encouraging our enemies. After all we've been through, Sigurd and Sven triumph. Well, I will not stay idle. Farewell, {playername}, and hope we do not meet again... for your sake.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside13:bodo_choiceside131|As I say, the Norns weave the threads at will.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside13:bodo_choiceside131.1|I guess this is farewell. I will be with my family, in Odinsve. Maybe in the future we see each other. I respect your decision, and I leave without rancor.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside131:bodo_choiceside132|Well... well I am with you.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside131:bodo_choiceside132.1|I'm not happy here, you know. I'm leaving. I think it is time to return to Konstantinoupolis.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside132:bodo_choiceside15|You put me between a rock and a hard place, but I gave my word, and I will keep it. I follow you.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside132:bodo_choiceside15.1|Sorry, but I don't fight against free men who have merely chosen to be Vikings. I said it, and I stand by it. It's time to find a new master. I hope you are treated well in West Seaxe, {reg59?my pretty:handsome}.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside14:bodo_choiceside141|I think you're wrong, but I'm loyal to you and follow you wherever you go.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside14:bodo_choiceside141.1|Our paths diverge, {playername}. Good luck. If you ever go through Friese, you might find me in my father's house... or maybe not.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside141:bodo_choiceside15|Well... well I am with you.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside141:bodo_choiceside15.1|I'm not happy here, you know. I'm leaving. I think it is time to return to Konstantinoupolis.
; dlga_bodo_choiceside15:close_window|It's time to get back on track. We have a mission underway.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp1:bodo_danishcamp2|Ragnar's sons are in a difficult situation. Besieged by the Saxons, they can easily be destroyed. We need to talk about this.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp2:bodo_danishcamp3|That would end the Danish invasion. Then the alliance would not be necessary, right?
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp2:bodo_danishcamp3_2|Very well. I will listen to you.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp3:bodo_danishcamp3_2|Yes, in part, but Danish attacks and Vikings raids have roots deeper than this one siege. Let me explain.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp3_2:bodo_danishcamp4|If you remember, {playername}, my king wants to put a stop to all the Vikings raids and safeguard his kingdom. Even if the Saxons may now force the sons of Ragnar locked in Snotingaham to surrender or kill them, there would still be other sons of Ragnar and other Danish men whose greed knows no limits. Perhaps the Saxons will get a few years of peace, adopt again old enmities with the Mercians, and forget about their alliance with the Franks and Asturians. Even so, the Danish would remain in Northhymbre, and Vikings would still infest the seas. After a few years, another leader would raise an army and would start this raiding and piracy all over again.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp4:bodo_danishcamp5_1|I think what you really fear is that the Saxons can do it without Asturias' help.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp4:bodo_danishcamp6|I think you're exaggerating. Gaed a wyrd swa hio scel!
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp4:bodo_danishcamp5_2|The Saxons could also very well attack Northhymbre and push out the Danish.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp4:bodo_danishcamp5_3|I think the Danish will defeat the Saxons in Snotingaham and then continue south.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp4:bodo_danishcamp6.1|What are you getting at, Bodo?
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp5_1:bodo_danishcamp6|You are clever, and you know me better than I thought, {playername}. My mission over the years has been to create and strengthen this alliance. Certainly, it affects me if that breaks. However, I want you to understand the full seriousness of this situation. I do not think I would exaggerate to call this a historical moment.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp5_2:bodo_danishcamp6|You've been in Danmark with me. Do you really believe your words? The Danish will send more men next year, and the year after.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp5_3:bodo_danishcamp6|Yes, this could happen... The Danish are people who stand up to the difficulties they face.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp6:bodo_danishcamp7|I ask you not to give my diplomatic letter to the Saxons just yet. First, we must resolve this siege situation, avoiding a battle if possible, because that would hurt my mission.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp7:bodo_danishcamp8_1|Honestly, without reinforcements, the Danish cannot be interested in fighting right now.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp7:bodo_danishcamp8|I am not sure what to do with the letter. Calm down.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp7:bodo_danishcamp8_2|I'll give it to the Saxons when I see fit.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp7:bodo_danishcamp8_2.1|I'll give it to the Danish when I see fit.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp7:bodo_danishcamp8.1|Do not worry, Bodo. I will follow your advice.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp8_1:bodo_danishcamp8|Yes, I think so, too, but I wanted to talk to you now.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp8_2:bodo_danishcamp8|When the time comes, we'll talk about this issue. Not now.
; dlga_bodo_danishcamp8:close_window|Well, I will not keep you any longer. Go see Bjorn Ironside Ragnarsson.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo1:companions_despuesduelo2|What happened was inevitable, my friend. It was him or you.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo2:companions_despuesduelo3|I understand the weight you carry on your shoulders, because I just experienced the same, after the massacre on the Woden Ric. I know no words can soothe you, but nobody expected Reginhard's betrayal. None of this is your fault.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo3:companions_despuesduelo3_1|Thank you for your words, but do not worry. I'm fine.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo3:companions_despuesduelo3_2|He deserved to die, and I'm not sorry.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo3:companions_despuesduelo3_3|I killed him... I do not think I can ever forgive myself. I'm a terrible person.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo3_2:companions_despuesduelo3_1|It seems that we should not worry about you; you are a person without feelings.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo3_3:companions_despuesduelo3_4|This isn't necessary. I thought you were someone strong, with fortitude.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo3_4:companions_despuesduelo3_1|{s2}^^Ignore him. He does not know how hard it can be.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo3_1:companions_despuesduelo4|{s2}^^My God, my God, I... I'm guilty, and I don't understand why you've forgiven me. I let Sigurd lie to me. I thought it was an opportunity to be happy with a house and a wife. So I blamed you for the death of Thiaderd, but the fault is really mine. I started it all when I betrayed him to the jarl of Kennemer. Everything I do, I do wrong, and now Egil is dead because of me. I deserve to die. Please kill me.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo3_1:companions_despuesduelo5|{s2}^^I do not understand all the tears. Reginhard betrayed us. I trusted him. Everybody trusted him. I thought he was a good guy, and what he did was spy for Sigurd. He sold us out for a house and a woman. Reginhard was a piece of shit and deserved his death.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo3_1:companions_despuesduelo5.1|Reginhard betrayed us. I trusted him. Everybody trusted him, but all he did was spy for Sigurd.

; dlga_companions_despuesduelo5:companions_despuesduelo5_2|No, he was a desperate man who had lost everything.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo5:companions_despuesduelo5_3|The piece of shit is you, and I want you out of my party now. Go back to your father.

; dlga_companions_despuesduelo5_3:close_window|{s2}^^Oh, to be sure, you won't! This is the best news I could have heard! I leave your pathetic little company to return to a true leader, a king, my father, Horik. I now leave you, save for my hope that they kill you in Englaland.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo4:companions_despuesduelo4_1|You are guilty, Reginhard. I spare your life, but get out of my sight forever.
; dlga_companions_despuesduelo4:companions_despuesduelo4_2|Yes, you are guilty, and I'll grant your wish to die. --You kill Reginhard--.

I sold one of my brothers to the jarl of Kennemer for money! I sold Thiedold, our leader's brother. Now they want to kill me, and I am awaiting my death as a betrayer.

; dlga_companion_reginhard42:companion_reginhard4|Thiaderd? Don't you know him? I cannot describe in words what kind of a person he is. The men would die for him, it is true.

; dlga_gartnait_historia1:gartnait_historia2|Among my people there are Goidels and Picts. They retain very few of their ancient traditions. We are Christians, but -- he whispers -- many customs of our ancestors still exist among our people. Young warriors are expected to paint their bodies and join the fray of battle and war before they are accepted in their homes as full-grown men. Women have the right to choose wives for their brothers, and children inherit through their mothers' lineage.^^Painting our bodies and joining warrior brotherhoods is part of a tradition in which young people must pass some tests in order to reach maturity. Some tests still involve venturing into distant lands in search of cattle and treasures, then to come home with enough wealth to start a family.

If you do, you devote yourself to a very old tradition and to powers that are beyond our understanding. Form or join a group of young people. Make a name for yourselves.

; dlga_eormenred_talk1:lord_pretalk|No thanks. I have other matters to attend to.
; dlga_eormenred_historia1:eormenred_historia2|Picts are strange, weird people. --He whispers.-- Some young warriors paint their bodies and become dangerous bandits. Pictish villages are dirty and hidden between the high peaks and dense forests that cover their land. I remember that from several years ago, when I took a war band of young warriors there to plunder and pillage.
; dlga_eormenred_historia2:eormenred_historia3|After days of travel, we spotted a village spread about a strange construction. Today, I know it was a Broch, a fortress erected by the ancients. The Picts found the ruins, repaired them, and built their homes under its protection. We felt a sudden surge of happiness. There was booty, cattle and women. -- He smiles. -- The doors and gates were wide open. They were not expecting us, we all thought. We started howling like wolves, excited by the prospect of battle. We prepared our spears and swords, gathered our shields and ran, certain that our victory was going to be as easy as it would be profitable. We were young, passionate, and anxious to show our worth.

; dlga_eormenred_historia4:eormenred_historia5|Yes, I know you are right, but back then we all were exceedingly impetuous. --He beats his chest.-- As for them, well, they were expecting us long before we even knew their village existed. They had archers, by Woden! ...beg pardon, by God! and an awful lot of arrows. Their Isenscur, or rain of arrows, was death to my men. One for one, arrow by arrow. Only I survived, for in fact they knew who I was... I was captured and forced to do their queen's bidding. When she tired of me, they ransomed me for a treasure worth many gold coins. My father gladly paid it when they sent him my left ear inside a finely wrought leather pouch. Hear me! Forget Pictland!

; dlga_maelbresail_dialog4_1:maelbresail_dialog4|I guess you still do not know me and the abbot gave no warning, but I prefer short and direct answers. My occupations are numerous and my time very limited.
; dlga_maelbresail_dialog4:maelbresail_dialog5|Your news is excellent. In fact, I want to reward you personally, in addition to what the abbot promised you, with 8,000 peningas. The people who work for me do not have to worry about money or wealth. All that I ask of them is to be faithful and execute my orders promptly.

; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan2|Honestly? I expected more.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_1|I do what I have to do.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_2|It has been a pleasure to serve you and kill your enemies.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_3|You lied to make me a murderer of your enemies.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan2:maelbresail_aftermorrigan3|You are ambitious, but I think you've been well paid. I will not give you a pening more until you deserve one.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan3|That's important to me. In this world, it is not easy to find effective people.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_2:maelbresail_aftermorrigan3|I know. Not all patrons reward their servants as well. Although it is sometimes difficult to know if your loyalty is to me or my money.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan2_3:maelbresail_aftermorrigan3|You were commissioned to do something, and you agreed to do it. Nobody forced you to accept. Why now come, whining? I cannot stand the capricious nor the faint-hearted.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan3:maelbresail_aftermorrigan4|--He chuckles.--^^I hear Morrigan tried to save her life with lies. What were her last words?
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan4:maelbresail_aftermorrigan5|She told me she was the last of the line of Flaithbertach.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan4:maelbresail_aftermorrigan5_2|She died before I could talk to her.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan5:maelbresail_aftermorrigan6|Working for Aed mac Niall, Ard Ruire of Eriu, you sent me to kill the remnants of the family Flaithbertach in order to remove potential rivals for the throne.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan5_2:maelbresail_aftermorrigan6|Do not lie! I know when you're lying. Liars have a place not at my side but on the gallows!
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan6:maelbresail_aftermorrigan7|You've done a huge favor to Eriu, if you're not aware of it. This island is populated by numerous clans, but each feels entitled to rule over others. The social system is a pyramid -- the weaker subject to the stronger, but all led by the high king, the Ard Ruire. However, the elements of this system constantly mutate, and clan alliances break according to changing interests. In sum, it is very difficult to rule this land.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan7:maelbresail_aftermorrigan8|I believe Aed mac Niall is a good leader, as he favors my interests, and therefore yours. However, Flaithbertach was a man beloved by the Ui-Neill, and his death caused much discomfort. His children could easily have taken up arms with many northern clans. As an internal war within the Kingdom of Aileach would only favor our rivals, the Southern Ui Neill, in their desire to secure once again the throne at Tara. Ard Ruire Aed is strong leader, uniquely able to keep the Vikings at bay. Do you understand?
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan8:maelbresail_aftermorrigan9_1|There is no need to justify our actions to me.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan8:maelbresail_aftermorrigan9_2|I hate politics.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan8:maelbresail_aftermorrigan10|Sure.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan9_1:maelbresail_aftermorrigan10|Justify? No, I am happy to do so.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan9_2:maelbresail_aftermorrigan10|Politics is what moves the world, but it's a game that you win or die.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan10:maelbresail_aftermorrigan11|Everything I've done has been for the benefit of Eriu. If I had directly attacked Flaithbertach's children, they would have become martyrs, and certain northern clans could have taken up arms under that pretext. You, however, were not among my people, so nobody can associate me. You and the abbot of Finian just killing with some other malefactors. We have not seen one another many times. Now it is your name that is famous for killing the children of Flaithbertach.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan11:maelbresail_aftermorrigan12|So you refuse me? After all I've done?
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan11:maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_2|I want more money, or I will talk to others about your involvement.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan11:maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_3|Traitor! Your hands remain clean while I will be hated by all the lords! (Intelligence)
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan11:maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_4|Well, Morrigan is still alive.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan12:maelbresail_aftermorrigan13|I never promised you anything I haven't paid. This arrangement was important to Eriu. Now, at least, I help you leave this island. Here many will hate you for killing Flaithbertach's children. I don't abandon any who has served me well, no matter how mercenary. I could reward you with 50,000 peningas. This should help you in your new life far from here.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_2:maelbresail_aftermorrigan13|Well, I understand. I guess I can pay you for your silence. How about 100,000 peningas? This should help you in your new life far from here
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_3:maelbresail_aftermorrigan13|You're smarter than you act. I cannot lie. This much is true: many a lord has put you on his list of enemies, but it was for the good of Eriu. However, I desire to give you enough gold for your exile from Eriu. Seventy thousand peningas should be sufficient to start a new life far from here.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan12_4:maelbresail_aftermorrigan13|Aah... I understand you're worried and will try to use anything to scare me. I know Morrigan is no longer a threat. You must leave Eriu as soon as possible, but this does not mean I not care about your welfare. I'll give you 30.000 peningas. This should be sufficient to start a new life far from here.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan13:maelbresail_aftermorrigan14|I guess I have no choice. I take your money and leave this island.
; dlga_maelbresail_aftermorrigan13:maelbresail_aftermorrigan14.1|Give me the money; then see what I'll do.

; dlga_maelbresail_pactofinal:maelbresail_pactofina2|I guess it is fair to recognize that you've exceeded all my expectations. You're much too dangerous to have as an enemy.

You may have no idea, but your patron is implacable. Recently, he sent men to kill to my brother in Pictland and his sons -- just children -- near Caer Meguaidd. Now, I am last of my family. I see it was impossible to hide from Mael Bresail. I found this remote part of the world and forgot my name by taking that of the goddess, Morrigan. Yet here you are to kill me.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog6:morrigan1_dialog1|Liar! You are trying to confuse me. It's time to die.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog6:morrigan1_dialog7|Then that would make you... Flaithbertach's daughter? No wonder you are a menace!
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog7:morrigan1_dialog8|My father, Flaithbertach, could have been king, but he was killed by his own brother, your master. This is Eriu. If you want the throne, you have to catch and eliminate all potential competitors. Fratricide is practically a way of life. Aed was faster to the deed than my father. Then, with the help of Mael Bresail, he killed my mother and the rest of my family. Just my brother, his sons, and I escaped, but Mael eventually found us. Now only I am alive, but even so, now at the tip of your sword.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog8:morrigan1_dialog1|Even so, you did too much damage to the people of Bal Luighne. You pay now with your life.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog8:morrigan1_dialog9|Mael Bresail used me? I am NOT his hired murderer!
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog9:morrigan1_dialog1|Well, that's hardly my problem. I'm tired of fleeing. Everyone I cared for is dead. I just want to see them again and be at peace. Go back to your master and collect your reward, murderer. I do not begrudge you that.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog9:morrigan1_dialog10|Mael Bresail uses everybody. What do you want to do now?
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog10:morrigan1_dialog1|You did too much damage to the people of Bal Luighne. You pay now with your life.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog10:morrigan1_dialog11|I will let you live, as I want answers from Mael Bresail. I will be back.
; dlga_morrigan1_dialog11:close_window|I'd rather go with you. You've killed my last supporter, and in any case, I do not want to try to hide anymore. I will join you, disguised as one of your warriors.
; dlga_morriganleave_final1:morriganleave_final2|I understand. I hope you find the peace that you wish.
; dlga_morriganleave_final1:morriganleave_final3|Morrigan, you cannot leave me. I need you.
; dlga_morriganleave_final2:morriganleave_final2_2|Thank you for understanding me. It has not been an easy decision. In your army, I feel protected, but this life is not for me. I need a place to call home, where I can be happy. Maybe someday we will meet again, but I think not. I just want you to know that you have become a very important person to me. I wish you luck, {playername}. The gods allow you to get everything that you deserve. You are destined for greatness.
; dlga_morriganleave_final3:morriganleave_final2_2|Do not make this difficult. My decision is made. This life is not for me. I need a place to call home, where I can be happy.

; dlga_start:ulf_dialog|Heill! My name is Ulf Thorirsson. My jarl, Sigurd Ragnarsson, notified me that you were coming. Welcome to my farm. You and your men can eat and sleep here until Sigurd's people arrive. The only thing I ask is that none of them comes close to my daughter, Thora.

; dlga_ulf_testigo15:ulf_testigo16_2|Ulf will be dead tomorrow, so my problem is solved. Why pay you a single pening?
; dlga_ulf_testigo15:ulf_testigo16_3|I will pay wergild of 4000 peningas to Ulf now, and the case is closed.
; dlga_ulf_testigo15:ulf_testigo16_4|No, I'm afraid not. I hate injustice and must settle my debt. I will fight on Ulf's behalf.
; dlga_ulf_testigo15:ulf_testigo16_4.1|No. The two matters are separate. I will both pay my wergild of 4000 peningas and fight.
; dlga_ulf_testigo16_1:ulf_testigo16|Well, well. A farm, a pretty girl and 2000 peningas to boot. The gods have always loved me. Good travels and good luck so that, someday, in the unlikely event that you ever make anything of yourself, we may meet again.

; dlga_revenge_kingmen:revenge_kingmen2|Sure, Harald! We're still waiting for the men of Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye.' My friend, here, is eager to meet Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_revenge_kingmen2:revenge_kingmen3|Welcome, Harald. We appreciate the help of King Horik.
; dlga_revenge_kingmen3:revenge_kingmen4|I'm sure of it. Until the time comes, I will keep my men hidden, ready to intervene if things get ugly. The king was very clear, {playername}. You must not begin hostilities. In fact, he wants you to avoid confrontation if at all possible.
; dlga_revenge_kingmen4:revenge_kingmen5|It will not be me who starts this battle. I promise.
; dlga_revenge_kingmen4:revenge_kingmen5.1|Sven Bull Neck did me much evil. I promise nothing.
; dlga_revenge_kingmen5:close_window|The king is a man who likes his wishes to be executed. Now we enter the farm. My men are hungry and thirsty.
; dlga_harald_meeting1:harald_meeting21|I am especially interested in this meeting. I have long been waiting to hear from my mother.
; dlga_harald_meeting1:harald_meeting3|(Say nothing)
; dlga_harald_meeting21:harald_meeting3|I think you may be wondering what our guest may have to say about this, but first we go to the most urgent matter.
; dlga_harald_meeting3:harald_meeting4|In Northhymbre, our Danish brothers have become strong. They control the kingdom through a puppet king. There are small uprisings of Angles, but these are localized and severely repressed. Nothing serious. The latest news we have is that the sons of Ragnar have moved south and taken a place, known as Snotingaham, in Mierce. The king of Mierce has not taken this well. He has besieged them there with his army, supported by the king of West Seaxe. We fear that the Ragnarssons may be in a hard place, so our mission is to go to Jorvik and join the forces that are gathering under Rathbarth, another of the sons of Ragnar, in support of his brothers. From there we will move south to meet the Angles and Saxons. With a little luck, we will kill their kings and the road south will be opened for plunder. You will come back rich to your wife and kids this year.
; dlga_harald_meeting4:harald_meeting4_1|I hope so. I have too many mouths to feed!
; dlga_harald_meeting4_1:harald_meeting4_2|{s2}^^You should have thought of that before having three wives and twenty children!
; dlga_harald_meeting4_2:harald_meeting5_1|I'm sure that he has as many bastards among his servants!
; dlga_harald_meeting4_2:harald_meeting5_2|The issue is serious. How many men do Mierce and West Seaxe have?
; dlga_harald_meeting4_2:harald_meeting5_3|Sounds like a good plan, Harald. My men will go in the front!
; dlga_harald_meeting4_2:harald_meeting5|I agree.
; dlga_harald_meeting5_1:harald_meeting5|{s2}.
; dlga_harald_meeting5_2:harald_meeting5|That is hard to say. The information we have comes from merchants and travelers. They speak of thousands of men. It hardly matters, though. The Angles and the Saxons are weak people, fully domesticated by their kings. It will be like attacking housewives.
; dlga_harald_meeting5_3:harald_meeting5_4|{s2}^^Well, well. We have here an authentic toady. It seems there is always someone who is willing to stoop to any depth to gain favor with the boss.
; dlga_harald_meeting5_4:harald_meeting5|I cannot stand sycophants, {playername}. Now let's move on to the serious stuff.
; dlga_harald_meeting5:harald_meeting6|{s2}^^Although everything is clear and our goal is near, it seems that problems with Sven Bull Neck don't stop cropping up. This captain, Oleif, is now with us, and he has very serious news. Go ahead, Oleif.
; dlga_harald_meeting6:harald_meeting7|{s2}^^I will not beat around the bush. Sven Bull Neck is unwilling to share command with Harald Haraldsson. At first opportunity, he will kill Harald and take the command. It may occur as we land, though I cannot be sure. Maybe my desertion of his party will change his mind.
; dlga_harald_meeting7:harald_meeting8|I am making a guard rotation during the trip. When we land, I will challenge Sven to a duel to the death. Sven Bull Neck is a lunatic, but he's a dangerous lunatic.
; dlga_harald_meeting8:harald_meeting8_1|Sounds good. You have my full support, even if you decide to attack his boat while he is still unprepared.
; dlga_harald_meeting8_1:harald_meeting9|You have my support too, Harald. That man, Sven, is very dangerous.
; dlga_harald_meeting9:harald_meeting11|I've been waiting long enough! What about my mother?
; dlga_harald_meeting9:harald_meeting11.1|You have my support, but I'd like to ask about my mother.
; dlga_harald_meeting9:harald_meeting10_3|I think Sven Bull Neck would make a better commander of this fleet than you.
; dlga_harald_meeting10_3:harald_meeting11|I see. May you be a slave to Sven Bull Neck like your mother. I despise you, {playername}, and you give me shame, but the Assembly forced us to work together. I will tell you as you have not heard.
; dlga_harald_meeting11:harald_meeting12|A woman travels with Sven Bull Neck. She is his seidr, one who accepts the spirit of the crow and speaks the words of Odin. Everybody reveres her, as she is a woman touched by the gods. Sven Bull Neck has married her in hopes of having a child touched by the gods, but she is old and her belly is dry. If she's your mother, I do not think she remembers you, as she has a curse that does not allow her to keep memories overnight.
; dlga_harald_meeting12:harald_meeting13|It looks like your mother now serves Sven Bull Neck. I hope you're prepared to deal with this when things get ugly.
; dlga_harald_meeting13:harald_meeting13_1|I...
; dlga_harald_meeting13_1:harald_meeting13_2|--All around you, the sudden tumult and shouting of men drowns out your answer. A warrior bursts into the meeting. He is hot, and his eyes show panic.--
; dlga_harald_meeting13_2:harald_meeting13_3|Hersir Harald, sir! Sven Bull Neck has attacked us! Half the fleet is charging us! Thor help us, Sven has caught us unprepared.
; dlga_harald_meeting13_3:close_window|{s3}^^Captains, return to your ships and lead your crew. Sven Bull Neck will pay dearly for this attack. If we should lose this battle, remember to inform Rathbarth Ragnarsson about this betrayal by Sven Bull Neck. Good luck. Now, to battle!
; dlga_start:svenfinal_ld1|{playername}! My lord advised me that you'd come. Sven Bull Neck has taken Readingum and has many men with him, mainly Danish, who have sworn allegiance. They are tough, battle-hardened people, same as Sven, who is a legend. I would not like to be in the shoes of you or your men.
; dlga_svenfinal_ld1:svenfinal_ld11|I am not afraid. It is the time of reckoning.
; dlga_svenfinal_ld1:svenfinal_ld2|Do you know if a woman is with him?
; dlga_svenfinal_ld1:svenfinal_ld3|Will you not stay and fight with us?
; dlga_svenfinal_ld2:svenfinal_ld11|You mean your mother, the seidr, right? Yes, she is with them. We saw her when she entered Readingum with Sven Bull Neck. I do not know how she was before, but now she is very gaunt and thin. I do not think she has long to live.
; dlga_svenfinal_ld3:svenfinal_ld11|I'm afraid not. My duties call me elsewhere. My role here was to make sure Sven Bull Neck would be here when you arrived. Apparently, my lord promised you this. He never breaks his word.
; dlga_svenfinal_ld11:close_window|Well, from what I've heard, you also are someone dangerous. I will leave the half a hundred men I promised my lord I would. They are brave warriors who have been promised a lot of gold to help you, so fight well. Farewell, {playername}, and good luck!
; dlga_start:close_window.64|I do not have time for you. Farewell.
; dlga_start:close_window.65|I do not have time for you. Farewell.
; dlga_svenlair_1:svenlair_2|I'm {playername}. I hear you have prisoners for sale.
; dlga_svenlair_1:close_window|I'm {playername}, but that's irrelevant, fool, because now we're going to kill you all!
; dlga_svenlair_1:svenlair_3|Goodness! I am lost! My apologies, I am leaving now.
; dlga_svenlair_3:close_window|Get out of here, trash! Never show your ugly face again, or you will pay dearly!
; dlga_svenlair_2:svenlair_21|Yet another slave merchant? I see. Well, I have a few slaves left.
; dlga_svenlair_21:svenlair_42|I would like to see these slaves.
; dlga_svenlair_21:svenlair_41|{playername}, to pay these men is to encourage them to keep attacking and enslaving people. We should make them pay dearly for the damage they do to people, not reward them for it!
; dlga_svenlair_41:svenlair_42|Keep your mouth shut! I would like to see these slaves.
; dlga_svenlair_41:close_window|You are right. We're going to kill you all!
; dlga_svenlair_42:svenlair_43|Well, I have three slaves. They're inside, down by the river. Go ahead and look at them, then come back to me to talk about buying them.
; dlga_svenlair_43:close_window|Sounds good! I'll look over the merchandise, and then we will talk money.
; dlga_sven_comprapr:sven_comprapr_todo|I understand. I'll take the three prisoners. Take your peningas. (900 peningas)
; dlga_sven_comprapr:sven_comprapr_trade|Look at them! Your men have starved and raped them. I'll pay 300 coin for the lot. (Trade)
; dlga_sven_comprapr:sven_comprapr_trade.1|They're in bad shape. Give them to me, and you won't have to feed them any more, deal? (Trade)
; dlga_sven_comprapr:close_window|I don't have that kind of money. Farewell.
; dlga_sven_comprapr:close_window.1|I've thought about it and I am not buying them. I'm leaving.
; dlga_sven_comprapr:close_window.2|I need more time. Let me look at them again.
; dlga_sven_comprapr_todo:close_window|Deal! The merchandise is yours. A good visit!
; dlga_sven_comprapr_trade:close_window|I see, I see. Well, I suppose you're right. The merchandise is yours. Take the stinkers away. Far thu vel.

; dlga_lord_talk:cundwalh_historia|I heard that you are a famous strategist.
dlga_pagano1_start:pagano1_action|{s4}
; dlga_cundwalh_historia:cundwalh_historial|That's right! Thanks to God, I am the best commander in Europe. My name has been long known and famous in all of Englaland, dog. I am a champion of West Seaxe. I have single-handedly killed twenty men in the chaos of war, and I have won over twenty battles since I started leading shield walls.
; dlga_cundwalh_historial:cundwalh_talk1|I've never, ever, suffered a defeat. You wish to learn from me, right? Then be good and listen to my words carefully tonight, or I will send one of my men to cut your throat with his seax.
; dlga_cundwalh_talk1:cundwalh_historia1|Yes, I'm interested.
; dlga_cundwalh_talk1:lord_pretalk|No thanks. I have other matters to attend to.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia1:cundwalh_historia2|I have good men, my beadupreat. They are ugly, stupid and cowardly, but they obey orders well. The first thing you need is men that obey orders without thinking too much.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia2:cundwalh_historia21|Then, you must teach them to advance in column. When they march this way, you travel the countryside without losing anybody. In battle, you must teach them to form ranks (by pressing F4 and F4) or squares (by pressing F4 and F7). It is easy to implement formations if you have a handy stick to beat the clumsy animal who may be unable to fit in properly.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia21:cundwalh_historia3|It is important that you know how to motivate your troops in battle. You can shout your barbaric war cry (by pressing the key T), which will undoubtedly scare away enemies surrounding you. You can always order your men to break the current formation (by pressing F4 and F8) so that they can properly charge into the enemy's lines.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia3:cundwalh_historia4|Mm, I see. Please continue.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia3:lord_pretalk|Stop. I don't need to hear more. Wes gesund.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia4:cundwalh_historia41|Anyway, in my opinion ranks are crap better left to the dirty Welsh. If you really want to win a battle, pay attention! You must use Scildweall (by pressing F4 and F5) which forces your men to form a shield wall. We learned this tactic from the Romans, and a shield wall is a very cohesive tactic for our land. This formation is great, a true battle winner, and you should learn it well, dog. Scildweall will allow you to win your battles, fighting shoulder to shoulder with your men. You need to train it until you have sore knees and hands calloused by the use of the spear and shield. Get off your horse if you have one, and join your men, leading by example. When the enemy is broken and is fleeing, call your horse if it is still alive (by pressing h), mount it and charge the cowards, killing as many as you can to instill fear in your future enemies. You can also try to use the Wecg formation (by pressing F4 and F6) which will bring your men into forming a wedge shaped fighting body.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia41:cundwalh_historia5|Hear me. This formation is difficult to master, so you should use it only with veteran troops. It is designed to break an enemy's Scildweall, but when you use it, you must know that you are playing for all or nothing. It is a risky bet, for, if you fail, your enemies will earn your flank and kill your men as if they were nothing more than dry grass. My personal advice is to use Scildweall against Scildweall, always. No need to take risks, I say. You can give weapon orders, too, (by pressing F5 key) or the order to skirmish (by pressing F6). That is all, dog. Learn soon, and quickly, because if one day we are in the battlefield as enemies, I will kill you. Wes gesund.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia5:lord_pretalk|Thank you, Lord. I have learned so much.
; dlga_cundwalh_historia5:lord_pretalk.1|Bah, someday I'll kill you. Farewell.

dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk|Lavoro brillante, {playername}! Dopo quello che avete fatto, i nobili del {s13} chiedono a gran voce la guerra! Ora è giunto il momento di mietere il raccolto delle nostre azioni, e con questo intendo che dobbiamo prendere a saccheggiare i feudi nemici. Questa guerra ci renderà ricchi, ricordate le mie parole!
; dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.1|You incompetent buffoon! What in Hell made you think that getting yourself captured while trying to start a war was a good idea? These plans took months to prepare, and now everything's been ruined! I will not forget this, {playername}. Oh, be assured that I will not.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_collect_debt_completed|I'm told that you've collected the money owed me from {s7}. Good, it's past time I had it back. I believe I promised to give you one-fifth of it all, eh?

; dlga_lord_start:close_window.2|Oh, it's you. Enlighten me, how exactly does one lose a simple fight to some poxy, lowborn merchant? Truly, if I ever need my guardsmen to take a lesson in how to lie down and die, I'll be sure to come to you. Just leave me be, {playername}, I have things to do.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go|You! Do you have sawdust between your ears? Did you think that when I said to kill the merchant, I meant you to have a nice chat with him and then let him go? What possessed you?

; dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2:lord_pretalk|Piffle. You were supposed to remove him, not give him a sermon and send him on his way. He had better do as you say, or you'll both regret it. Here, this is half the money I promised you. Don't say a word, {playername}. You're lucky to get even that. I have little use for {reg59?people:men} who cannot follow orders.
; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_completed|Beautiful work, {playername}! You captured both the spy and his handler, just as I'd hoped, and the two are now safely ensconced in my dungeon, waiting to be questioned. My torturer shall be busy tonight!

; dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you! I wanted TWO prisoners, {playername} -- what you've brought me is one step short of useless! I already know everything the spy knows. It was the handler I was after. Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|Vi ho richiesto due prigionieri, {playername}, non uno. Due. Eppure, pare che abbiate catturato l'addestratore della spia, il più importante della coppia.

; dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Humph. That is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I need to recruit new men to work these fields before we all starve.

; dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were three groups of serfs that I charged you to return. Three, not {reg17}.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge4:kinghorik_quest_revenge51|Thank you, King Horik. I brought with me Brunhild and Bodo. They are trustworthy.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge4:kinghorik_quest_revenge52|Let me tell you my story...
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge51:kinghorik_quest_revenge52|Yes, yes, nice to meet them. Now, to the point. My time is limited.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge52:kinghorik_quest_revenge53|Recently, the boat I was traveling on was attacked by Vikings of Sven Bull Neck, a man of Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye.'
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge53:kinghorik_quest_revenge54|{s2}^^That is nothing special. Many jarls in Danmark have people who make themselves Vikings. Even the jarls and I were Vikings once. I hope you're not wasting my time... Choose your words carefully, or this conversation is over.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge54:kinghorik_quest_revenge61|Sven Bull Neck has captured my mother, and he has brought her to Sigurd.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge54:kinghorik_quest_revenge62|Sigurd tried to make the jarl of Kennemer king of Friese in exchange for an army.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge54:kinghorik_quest_revenge63|My companion Bodo had something important from the king of Asturias that Sigurd wanted.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge54:kinghorik_quest_revenge64|Sven Bull Neck has a hideout near Ribe, where he took the Woden Ric prisoners.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge54:kinghorik_quest_revenge65|Sven Bull Neck and Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' are up to something, and I want to stop them.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge61:kinghorik_quest_revenge21_2|{s2}^^Your mother? This is because Sigurd took your mother? You have wasted my time. I will not talk more. It's time for you to go.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge62:kinghorik_quest_revenge21_2|{s2}^^An army? This is your mystery? He is gathering men for Englaland, in the aid of my brothers. I myself have allowed my jarls and hersirs to join the expedition if they wish. Englaland is a rich land, inhabited by habitually weak people, waiting to be dominated and plundered by their betters. +You have wasted my time. I will not talk more. It's time for you to go.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge64:kinghorik_quest_revenge21_2|{s2}^^You tell me things I already know, and you do not interest me. My patience has a limit, and you have quickly reached it. +You have wasted my time. I will not talk more. It's time for you to go.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge21_2:close_window|Our meeting is over.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge65:kinghorik_quest_revenge55|Sven and Sigurd are hated and feared by many men. The question is if they are up to something that could affect me.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge55:kinghorik_quest_revenge61|Sven Bull Neck has my mother, and he has brought her to Sigurd.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge55:kinghorik_quest_revenge62|Sigurd tried to make the jarl of Kennemer king of Friese in exchange for an army.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge55:kinghorik_quest_revenge63|My companion Bodo had something important from the king of Asturias that Sigurd wanted.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge55:kinghorik_quest_revenge64|Sven Bull Neck has a hideout near Ribe, where he took the Woden Ric prisoners.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge63:kinghorik_quest_revenge67|I guess I can no longer maintain the secret, but this is not the place, nor are you the person. However, if I do not speak now, the danger is worse and could be terrible.^^The attack on the Woden Ric was no random act of piracy.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge67:kinghorik_quest_revenge68_1|My name is Bodo Vimaraniz from Malacoria, in Cantabria. I come from King Aldefonso of Asturias. I was sent north with a present for Aethelred, king of West Seaxe. This present and I are the reason Sven Bull Neck attacked the Woden Ric. Sigurd Ragnarsson wants this present for himself, because he wants to be the king of Danmark while his brothers are kings in Englaland.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge68_1:kinghorik_quest_revenge68|I know that Sigurd wants to be king. How could a gift give him my throne?
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge68:kinghorik_quest_revenge69|The Ragnarssons are powerful men, with lands in many places, like Danmark, Sweoland and now Northhymbre. Right now, it seems that their efforts are against Englaland, and they are, but this means ensuring that Danmark provide easy access to resources and warriors. If Sigurd is king here, he will guarantee all that. Moreover, now he can unite the Danish, for the gift I was carrying was the sword of Ragnar Lodbrok. His sons, Bjorn Ironside and Haesten, lost it when a Muslim fleet defeated them south of Al-Andalus.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge69:kinghorik_quest_revenge7|How did you get the sword from the Muslims?
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge69:kinghorik_quest_revenge7.1|Bodo, I'm impressed. You know a lot about the Danish. What are you not telling me?
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge69:kinghorik_quest_revenge71|(Say nothing)
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge7:kinghorik_quest_revenge71|It was a gift to my king made by the emir of Al-Andalus in exchange for valuable prisoners. Aethelred, king of West Seaxe, was very interested in this sword, and my king Aldefonso got it for him.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge7:kinghorik_quest_revenge71.1|I have been before in the north, but this is not important now.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge71:kinghorik_quest_revenge72|Ragnar was more than a man. The skalds revere him as god, and the men feed their souls with his legend. Sigurd could carry the sword to the Assembly and claim the merit of recovering it. He might demand to be king and even kill me, and everyone might just forgive him for having recovered his father's sword. Ragnar's sword must be destroyed before anyone knows it exists.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge72:kinghorik_quest_revenge73|Then maybe we can make a deal: sword for support.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge72:kinghorik_quest_revenge732|(Brunhild seems to want to say something. Let her.)
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge73:kinghorik_quest_revenge74|I have business with Sigurd and Sven. I want your protection and support when I need it.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge74:kinghorik_quest_revenge8|Yes, this is what we do. That sword cannot come to light, but we need to be cautious. Sigurd Ragnarsson is a shrewd man, and he won't attack openly. Go see him for the issues you mentioned to me and try to get the sword. I do not care if you steal it, buy it, or promise eternal loyalty, so long as he leaves it in your hands. What I want is that you bring me this sword to destroy. In return, when you bring the sword, you'll have my protection while in Danmark, and so I will proclaim, and Sigurd Ragnarsson will not dare to go against you. Now I must go. I've been too long with you, and I have other matters to attend to. Good luck and farewell.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge732:kinghorik_quest_revenge75|My king, it was I who told my companions to come to see you before we talk to Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye.' I know that he is a dangerous man, as I served in the house of the jarl of Kennemer. We ask for your protection and support for our cause, because {playername}'s mother is in the hands of Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' and Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge75:kinghorik_quest_revenge8|I understand, girl. You have my support, but I want Ragnar's sword. Sigurd will not kill you, so go talk to him. If you need to, tell him that you are under my protection. It is important that you succeed in giving me the sword. I do not care if you have to steal it, but bring it to me. Now I must go. I've been too long with you, and I have other matters to attend to. Good luck and farewell.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge8:kinghorik_quest_revenge81|{s2}^^{playername}, I have lied to the king. Well, it's not totally a lie. Everything is true except the existence of the sword. I know that the Danish give much importance to everything that has to do with Ragnar, and I used that. It was a risk, but we needed the king on our side. I hope you understand.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge81:kinghorik_quest_revenge82|The sword was important for getting the king's support. Thank you. Now, tell me the truth.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge81:kinghorik_quest_revenge84|No, Bodo! I don't know your game, but do not lie in the future. Now tell me the whole truth.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge81:kinghorik_quest_revenge84.1|Lying isn't tolerable, never lie again, Bodo, or I will take action against you. (Justice)
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge82:kinghorik_quest_revenge84|I disagree. How can we now justify to the king that there is no sword? Lying only brings problems. Everyone knows that. At least, everyone ought to know that.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge84:kinghorik_quest_revenge85|{s2}^^I am an honorable man. Honor is my law, but I owe allegiance to my king and to the mission that he entrusted to me. It took years of visiting this foreign land since the Rex Ordonio, father of current king of Asturias, sent me. This is hard to understand, but Asturias is a small kingdom, where every man must fight as a warrior or die at the hands of our enemies. We fight every year against the power of Al-Andalus. It is a constant front, and we thought our backs were safe until the Vikings arrived. Old King Ordonio, and now his son, King Aldefonso, want an alliance with Frankia and West Seaxe to protect ourselves from the Vikings and make the seas safer.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge85:kinghorik_quest_revenge86|I carried a letter sealed by my king himself for the king of West Seaxe. It is a letter of alliance that had to be sent in secret, lest it be intercepted. And I failed. The letter is now in the hands of Sigurd Ragnarsson, one of the men who tried to protect us. Do you understand the pity of it? Not so long ago his brothers, Bjorn Ironside and Halfdan, attacked Gallaecia, the western part of the Kingdom of Asturias.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge86:kinghorik_quest_revenge87|{playername}, Bodo isn't well, and we shouldn't lose more time here. It is time to talk to Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye.'
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge87:close_window|We're in rush now, but we'll talk about your mission later, Bodo. Now, let's go.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_revenge87:close_window.1|Well, let's bother Bodo no more. We're looking for Sigurd.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot1|Sigurd Ragnarsson sent men to kill us at Ulf's farmstead.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot2|Sigurd promised to give me Sven and my mother at Ulf's farm, but we were attacked instead.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot2:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot1|Sigurd will not deliver up Sven Bull Neck, his best man. If you believed he would do such a thing, then you're dumber than I thought.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot1:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot3|My king, as you've asked me, I've been your eyes and ears. I know all the important information, because in {playername}'s camp there are no secrets. As you already know, {playername} is the one who broke Sigurd's plans to put a puppet on the throne of Friese. It was more likely an accident than a deliberate act, as {playername} is looking for Sven Bull Neck, Sigurd's first man, for revenge, because Sven has imprisoned {playername}'s mother. When {playername} talked to Sigurd, they agreed that, in exchange for Bodo the Cantabrian, Sigurd would deliver up Sven and {playername}'s mother at Ulf's farm.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot3:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot4|Yes, it is more or less what I expected.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot3:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot4.1|{s2}^^Yes, I heard that Sigurd holds Bodo prisoner. Bodo will be tortured, and when they finish, Sigurd will kill him and deliver his body to Njord.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot4:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot41|Egil, traitor, you're nothing but a spy!
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot4:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot5|--Do not say anything.--
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot41:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot42|{s2}^^I'm no traitor. I'm loyal to my king, and I'm helping you more than you think. King Horik has a network of informants in all locations, and he already knew about you, but especially Bodo, before you arrived.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot42:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot5|Egil, continue. You know that my time and my patience are limited.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot5:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot6|There is a problem. Sigurd sent Olvir White Hair to kill {playername}. Olvir has died, but not before declaring that Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' would take his case to the Assembly. I'm sure Ulf will be one witness in his favor. By now, my king, many have seen {playername} talking to you. Sigurd could use this against you.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot6:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot61|{s2}^^You have traveled with {playername}. What do you think of {reg59?her:him}?
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot61:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot7|I admire {reg59?her:him}. {reg59?She:He} is someone with a very clear mind, tireless goals and favor with the gods. {reg59?Her:His} luck is greater than that of other men and women I have known. You can trust {reg59?her:him} to help us advance our agenda.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot61:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot7.1|{reg59?She:He} is a bad leader, stupid, stubborn, and unbearable. Many times I had to restrain myself not to spit in {reg59?her:his} face. But {reg59?her:his} luck is greater than I have known. I do not know how, but {reg59?she:he} is always victorious. {reg59?She:He} will help us advance our agenda.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot61:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot7.2|I have not much to say. {reg59?She:He} is someone pretty normal. I have not seen anything special. Well, except for one thing: {reg59?her:his} luck. {reg59?Her:His} luck is greater than I have known. I do not know how, but {reg59?she:he} is always victorious. {reg59?She:He} will help us advance our agenda.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot7:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot8|{s2}^^Bodo's mission was not a secret, neither for me nor for Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye,' despite all the means taken to make it so. There's a man in the court of Asturias willing to do anything to finish off their king, Aldefonso. Can you believe it? Although that kingdom is so far away, they have the same problems that we do! I knew all about this long before you came to see me for the first time, although I pretended to know nothing.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot8:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot81|I do not like anybody playing with me, even a king.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot8:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot81.1|You laughed at us when we first spoke.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot8:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot9|I see. You and Sigurd play a game of intrigues for the throne, and I'm in the middle.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot8:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot9.1|--Say nothing.--
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot81:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot9|Do not be so dramatic, though I like your boldness. I needed to see what Sigurd was willing to risk. Clearly, the stakes are high, and Sigurd is very interested in killing you.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot9:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot10|{s2}^^Sigurd wants my kingdom. He has gathered an army with the excuse of going to help his brothers in Englaland, but I fear he could use these men to take my throne if he gets favor in the Assembly. Now he has two options to play for such favor: first, Bodo's letter from the Kingdom of Asturias and second, Olvir White Hair's death.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot10:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot11|Our fates are crossed, {playername}. The soothsayers told me about you before you came. They said that a {reg59?woman:man} whose luck is greater than that of Sigurd would come, a {reg59?woman:man} who will save my throne. You want Sven Bull Neck and your mother, and I want to thwart Sigurd's plans. I'll help you and you help me. From now on, you have my official protection in Danmark.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot11:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot111|Can you tell me what your plans are?
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot11:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot112|You take for granted too many things. I am not in your service. I do not think I need you.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot112:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot12|I see that you are so dense that you need every bit of luck the gods have compensated you with. Now listen closely. You need to go to the Assembly, where you cannot go without my patronage. There will be Sven Bull Neck, the man who wants to accuse you of the death of his brother. If you aren't at the Assembly, you won't be able to defend yourself, so you will lose. Then the Assembly will banish you and put you outside the protection of the law. Any and every Dane is free to kill or otherwise mistreat such an outlaw, so, to the contrary, you very much need me if you wish to get your mother back and kill Sven. Now, listen to me.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot113:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot12|Sounds good, and it's just. While our interests run together, we will be allies. Then, you'll be leaving Danmark.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot12:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot13|{s2}^^There is a man named Guthrum, who is a faithful man respected in Danmark. I will ask him to lead Sigurd's Vikings to provide support for the invasion of Englaland by the sons of Ragnar. However, my proposal will not succeed if Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' presents Bodo's letter in the Assembly or if he can associate me with the death of Olvir White Hair.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot13:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot14|Unfortunately, the letter has been hidden. My contacts say that Sigurd gave it to Atli Eiriksson, his second man after Sven Bull Neck. Atli sailed from Ribe some time ago, and no one knows his fate. Perhaps the Ribe port master knows something, but he will not talk to my people. You have to get this letter soon while I buy loyalties for the Assembly.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot14:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot151|Getting the information could be expensive. I need more money.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot14:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot151.1|I'll take care of this, but need some financial help.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot14:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot16|The port master and I will have a few words.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot151:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot153|I know the Ribe port master, and he is an ambitious man. We need enough money to purchase the information.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot153:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot16|Well, I reserve some of my treasure for these contingencies. You may take 15,000 peningas. I hope it's enough to pay the port master and for other possible expenses.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot16:kinghorik_quest_danmarkprot17|Also, if you want to keep your head on your neck, I would suggest you talk to Ulf and convince him not to testify against you at the Assembly. Another thing that might help would be to have good relations with the jarls of Danmark, so that they will speak well of you at the Assembly. I would recommend you meet them and try to get acquainted

I didn't use Brunhild. We both had fun. It's her fault if she thought that it was something more. She should've known that someone like me will never marry, and certainly not a Frisian slave. You can think whatever you want, but thanks to me, you have the support of my father.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething3:kinghorik_quest_thething4|No matter, I think they are also awaiting your arrival, which means that maybe I should not have sent for you. I suspect they have some ploy to launch. Sigurd Ragnarsson has complained of 800 men who cannot board because I will not let him lead them. That much is true, because I proposed that Guthrum lead them. The problem is that Guthrum some days ago suffered the misfortune to have been killed on his farm. They accuse outlaws and criminals of burning down his house whilst he was hosting a feast inside. I think that it was Sven Bull Neck, the prow man of Sigurd's hird, who did it, but I have no evidence or witnesses. Everything and everyone was burned with the house.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething4:kinghorik_quest_thething5|Everything taken together, the situation is quite serious. Since Guthrum is dead, Sigurd is pushing hard to gain control of those 800 men. I fear he wishes to use them to take my throne.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething8:kinghorik_quest_thething81|{s2}^^Men of Danmark, you know me. When I was little more than a child, I was with Ragnar when he sacked Frankia with 120 ships and more than 4,000 men, an adventure that the skalds still relate. I am the man who led 400 Vikings in West Seaxe, the strongest kingdom in Englaland, to obtain great fame and wealth. Therefore, men fear me across Friese, Englaland, and Frankia, but here in Danmark, they rightfully respect and love me.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething81:kinghorik_quest_thething82|I had a brother, Olvir White Hair, a better man than me. He was a man of honor, loved by the gods, but in the prime of life, he was murdered. Now the king protects his murderer. I have never demanded anything of the Assembly, but now I call for justice. Is it right that his murderer be here, among us, or that a king protect evil? Shall murderers go unpunished in this land?^^{s2}
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething82:kinghorik_quest_thething83|{s2}^^It's what we expected. They use you to attack King Horik and undermine his authority.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething83:kinghorik_quest_thething85|{s2}^^Everyone knows your worth, Sven Bull Neck, and the feats you've done in your past, but your words seem to indicate that a king could support a murderer. This charge is very grave. The Assembly shall now listen to King Horik's response.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething85:kinghorik_quest_thething86|Sven insults me. I have never protected nor will ever protect a murderer. If that were what I was doing, it was in ignorance. {playername} came to me for protection as a free {reg59?lady:man}, and I gave it to {reg59?her:him} after {reg59?she:he} proved {reg59?her:his} worth. The story {reg59?she:he} told me about the death of Olvir White Hair is quite different.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething86:kinghorik_quest_thething9|Now, it is time for the accused to speak on this matter.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething9:kinghorik_quest_thething90|You decide to discredit Sven Bull Neck. (Persuasion)
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething9:kinghorik_quest_thething91|You decide to appeal to the crowd's sympathy by mentioning your mother's kidnapping.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething9:kinghorik_quest_thething92|You think it better to describe events without mentioning your mother's kidnapping.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething90:kinghorik_quest_thething90_1|My name is {playername}. Olvir White Hair tried to kill me at the behest of his brother, Sven Bull Neck. I was at peace on Ulf's farm, where I had gone by agreement with Sigurd Ragnarsson, present here today. Olvir White Hair came there with several men to try to kill me. As I always take strong issue with such a project, it was Olvir who died. I ask you, why did Sven send Olvir if he is the one who wants to get rid of me? I think it's because he fears me. Despite all of his bold words, he is in fact a coward who attacks defenseless ships and hides behind the cloak of his lord.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething91:kinghorik_quest_thething94|My name is {playername}, and I'm no murderer. Olvir's death was self-defense. Sven Bull Neck had kidnapped my mother, but Sigurd Ragnarsson promised to give her back to me at Ulf's farm. Instead, he sent Olvir White Hair to kill me. Although Olvir White Hair fought hard during the battle, he was wounded and died.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething92:kinghorik_quest_thething95|My name is {playername}, and I'm no murderer. Olvir's death was self-defense. I was at Ulf's farm, waiting for Sigurd Ragnarsson's messenger. Instead, Olvir White Hair came and attacked me, but he was mortally wounded during the battle.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething90_1:kinghorik_quest_thething95|{s2}^^Well spoken. I think you've left him speechless.

My father, King Horik, is always concerned about what happens in this land. He compelled me to travel with {playername}. Olvir White Hair came with many men. I swear it was he who started the fight. Olvir died a good death, but he was the one who caused the melee. {playername} isn't guilty of murder.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething11:kinghorik_quest_thething11_1|Unfortunately for you, I can show that you are a liar. Olvir did not die a good death, for the murderer has Olvir's sword. {reg59?She:He} did not let my brother hold the sword in his last moments, denying him Walhalla. Egil is a liar, and his testimony is not valid.

; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething24:kinghorik_quest_thething25_1|In the case of the death of Olvir White Hair, Sven Bull Neck shall receive wergild of 4800 peningas. {playername}, can you pay this wergild now?
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething24:kinghorik_quest_thething25_2|In the case of the death of Olvir White Hair, this Assembly rules that {playername} acted in self-defense and declares him innocent.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething25_1:kinghorik_quest_thething26|This is an outrage! 4800 peningas for the life of my brother? This should be paid with blood!
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething26:kinghorik_quest_thething27|{s2}^^Sven Bull Neck accepts the decision of the Assembly.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething25_2:kinghorik_quest_thething26_2|What? This is not justice! This Assembly pisses on the grave of my brother!
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething26_2:kinghorik_quest_thething30_2|{s2}^^Sven Bull Neck accepts the decision of the Assembly.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething27:kinghorik_quest_thething28|{playername}, can you pay this wergild now?
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething28:kinghorik_quest_thething30|I have the money.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething28:kinghorik_quest_thething29|No, I don't have this money.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething29:kinghorik_quest_thething30|I respect the finding of this Assembly, although I do not share it. I will pay the wergild of {playername}.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething29:kinghorik_quest_thething29_2|Will anyone pay wergild for this {reg59?lady:man}, or shall {reg59?she:he} be declared outlaw. {reg59?She:He} will lose everything that {reg59?she:he} owns and shall be removed from the protection of the law, even if killed.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething29_2:kinghorik_quest_thething30|We, the members of {reg59?her:his} hird, will pay this wergild, in order that {playername} may remain free to continue leading us.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething30:kinghorik_quest_thething31|Then the Assembly accepts the money and gives it to Sven Bull Neck. The price for spilt blood has been satisfied. Before gods and men, this quarrel has ended between these two men.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething30_2:kinghorik_quest_thething31|Well, the Assembly has spoken. Before gods and men, this quarrel has ended between these two men.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething31:kinghorik_quest_thething31_2|Odin, Thor and Frey have heard what is here decided. May they punish any who do not fulfill their oaths.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething31_2:kinghorik_quest_thething33|Regarding the case of the witness called Reginhard, who has been accused of lying, the gods must decide his culpability. As the accusation is grave, this Assembly has decided that {playername} and Reginhard will engage in a holmgang, a duel to the death, on the island called Short, within six days. Two will go, but only one return. If one of them fails to show up, {reg59?he or she:he} will be declared nithingr, coward, less than a man, and this will be told by skalds and messengers to all men in Danmark and abroad.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33:kinghorik_quest_thething33_4|I accept the decision of the Assembly.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33:kinghorik_quest_thething33_1|I refuse to kill Reginhard.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33_1:kinghorik_quest_thething33_2|Do you wish to be a nithingr? Nobody will follow you. Everybody will be free to kill you. Moreover, you are agreeing with Reginhard, who has betrayed us. I argue that Reginhard is a liar, and if you do not face him, giving the reason, I say that you're a liar too.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33_2:kinghorik_quest_thething33_3|The decisions of the Assembly cannot be gainsaid. They are backed by the gods and the free men of Danmark. The sentence is a duel to discover the lie. {playername}, you must choose: fight against Reginhard or defend him against Egil.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33_3:kinghorik_quest_thething33_4|I will fight against Reginhard.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33_3:kinghorik_quest_thething33_4.1|I will fight against Egil.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33_4:kinghorik_quest_thething33_5|I accept the decision of the Assembly too. I'm no liar, but I regret having been a traitor. I am very sorry, {playername}.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33_5:kinghorik_quest_thething33_6|Well, when this Assembly is over, the important men of Danmark will come get you and take you to Short Island to face your opponent.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33_6:kinghorik_quest_thething33_7|Odin, Thor and Frey have heard what has here been decided. May they punish any who do not fulfill their oaths.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething33_7:kinghorik_quest_thething34|This Assembly has also decided on a last major issue. The accusations and insults between King Horik and Jarl Sigurd can cause serious damage to Danmark. Therefore, this assembly of free men, which is above jarls and kings and answers only to the gods, has decided that a reconciliation between the two must occur. King Horik will give Jarl Sigurd a position on his council and among his most beloved men. Moreover, King Horik will pay 15.000 peningas in compensation for all the efforts made by the Sigurd in organizing the expedition.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething34:kinghorik_quest_thething35|{s2}^^In return, Jarl Sigurd shall remain by King Horik, advising him and not leaving Danmark. Therefore, Jarl Sigurd Ragnarsson must relinquish control over the fleet that shall relieve his brethren. This fleet will be lead by two other men: Sven Bull Neck, on the part of Jarl Sigurd, and Harald Haraldsson, on the part of King Horik. The fleet will depart for Englaland in a few days without further delay.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething35:kinghorik_quest_thething36_1|It is furthermore our decision that {playername} shall join as advisor of Harald Haraldsson, as long as the gods give {reg59?her:him} the victory in the holmgang. Otherwise, Egil takes {playername}'s place and hird. One or the other should meet with me in the mead hall of Ribe once the holmgang is over.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething36_1:kinghorik_quest_thething36|{s2}^^The Assembly, representing the gods and freemen of Danmark, has spoken.^These are the two parties, right? King Horik? Jarl Sigurd?
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething36:kinghorik_quest_thething37|I accept the judgment of the Assembly. I will fulfill my part as has been decreed. I swear that I will uphold and enforce it.^^{s2}
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething37:kinghorik_quest_thething38|{s2}^^I also accept the decision of the Assembly. I swear that I will uphold and enforce it.
; dlga_kinghorik_quest_thething38:close_window|Odin, Thor and Frey have heard what has been decided here. May they punish anyone who does not fulfill his oath. This Assembly has ended. Everyone may leave now.
; dlga_alfredthegreat1:alfredthegreat21|(You bow before him)
; dlga_alfredthegreat1:alfredthegreat22|(Do not bow to him)
; dlga_alfredthegreat21:alfredthegreat3|{s2}^^Regards, Danish envoy. What do your masters want now?
; dlga_alfredthegreat22:alfredthegreat3|{s2}^^You are a proud {reg59?woman:man}, but you should know that an envoy should be courteous and take full advantage of diplomacy. What do your masters want now?
; dlga_alfredthegreat3:alfredthegreat41|I have a letter for you from Bjorn, son of Ragnar.
; dlga_alfredthegreat3:alfredthegreat42|I have a letter for you from Bjorn. They know they will lose and want a truce.
; dlga_alfredthegreat3:alfredthegreat43|I have a letter for you from Bjorn. They are still willing to negotiate.
; dlga_alfredthegreat41:alfredthegreat5|{s2}^^The Danish want to meet with us to negotiate the terms of their retreat. This is good news.
; dlga_alfredthegreat42:alfredthegreat5|{s2}^^The Danish want to meet with us to negotiate the terms of their retreat. Thank you for the information about their weakness, but I think we are still interested in this deal.
; dlga_alfredthegreat43:alfredthegreat5|{s2}^^While I admire your loyalty to your masters, do not treat me like a fool. We have received news of the disaster of the fleet sent from Danmark, and in the north, the Danish have many problems with Picts. However, we have our own problems right now, so this deal is good for us.
; dlga_alfredthegreat5:alfredthegreat6|But my lord, that means they are defeated. We should attack and finish them.
; dlga_alfredthegreat6:alfredthegreat7|Do not underestimate the enemy, Uthred. We will take this opportunity to make peace.
; dlga_alfredthegreat7:alfredthegreat81|It's a good opportunity to avoid further bloodshed on either side.
; dlga_alfredthegreat7:alfredthegreat82|You can annihilate us now, but next year the Danish will return with more men.
; dlga_alfredthegreat7:alfredthegreat83|(Say nothing)
; dlga_alfredthegreat81:alfredthegreat9|Sod is paet thu segst! I'm glad to see that we agree. The Danish have many men in Snotingaham yet, and the walls are high. Even if we could win this battle, I'm not sure we'd want to. In addition, the winter could see us still besieging this place, and we are far from home. As hard as it would be for them to starve inside, it would be harder for us to starve outside.
; dlga_alfredthegreat82:alfredthegreat9|You are a soldier, not a leader. When the lives of others depend on you, you must weigh your options carefully. Not everything is resolved with blood. The Danish have many men in Snotingaham yet, and the walls are high. Even if we could win this battle, I'm not sure we'd want to. In addition, the winter could see us still besieging this place, and we are far from home. As hard as it would be for them to starve inside, it would be harder for us to starve outside.

; dlga_alfredthegreat9:close_window|Well, go back to your jarl, Bjorn Ragnarsson, and tell him that we are ready to negotiate their way out of Snotingaham and lasting peace. I give notice to my men not to attack you. Beod ge gesunde.
; dlga_ragnarssons_1:ragnarssons_2_1|Jarl Bjorn Ragnarsson sends me.
; dlga_ragnarssons_1:ragnarssons_2_2|I cannot talk about this.
; dlga_ragnarssons_2_1:ragnarssons_3|{s2}^^It is nice to hear. Bjorn Jarnsida, Ironside, is a legend, possibly the Ragnarsson most loved by Odin. Just have out your news. What is happening?
; dlga_ragnarssons_2_2:ragnarssons_3|{s2}^^I see. Just have out your news. What is happening?
; dlga_ragnarssons_3:ragnarssons_3_1|The reinforcements that were coming from Danmark were destroyed for treason.
; dlga_ragnarssons_3:ragnarssons_3_2|Jarl Bjorn wants to negotiate your surrender with the Saxons.
; dlga_ragnarssons_3:ragnarssons_3_3|We have destroyed Saxon foragers!
; dlga_ragnarssons_3:ragnarssons_3_4|I cannot talk about this.
; dlga_ragnarssons_3_1:ragnarssons_4|{s2}^^But this is terrible! Our leaders told us that reinforcements were on the way and that we could then easily defeat the Saxons. By Thor! This changes everything!
; dlga_ragnarssons_3_2:ragnarssons_4|I do not believe that! Bjorn would never deliver us to the Saxons. You're a liar!
; dlga_ragnarssons_3_3:ragnarssons_4|Well, lovely news! I hope they pay dearly for this siege.
; dlga_ragnarssons_3_4:ragnarssons_4|I see. I do not understand the secrecy. News always helps to improve morale, but I guess that you have orders about it, so I do not insist.
dlga_ragnarssons_4:ragnarssons_5|{s2}
; dlga_ragnarssons_5:ragnarssons_6|Enough talk here. Ulf, go back to the wall, and take your men with you. My brothers and I want to be alone with the newcomer.
; dlga_ragnarssons_6:ragnarssons_7|Heill, messenger! My name is Halfdan, and these here are my brothers, Ivar and Hubbi. We rejoiced much when they told us that a messenger had passed through the Mercian lines. What news do you bring us?
; dlga_ragnarssons_7:ragnarssons_8|Your bother, Bjorn, sent me to inform you that the reinforcements from Danmark are lost because Sven Bull Neck turned his men against the rest. There will be no reinforcements. Bjorn Ironside wants to convene a meeting with the Saxon and Mercian leaders to restore Snotingaham to them in exchange for them letting you back north with your armies.^^This seax, which belonged to Ragnar, certifies that I come from your brother and speak the truth.
; dlga_ragnarssons_8:ragnarssons_9|Damn Bjorn! He's old and had his glory, but now begrudges us ours. The Saxons and the Angles are weak peoples. If it were me, I would attack their camps and put them to flight like the mice they are.
; dlga_ragnarssons_9:ragnarssons_10|No more nonsense, Hubbi. We have but one man for every five Saxons. To fight outside these walls is only foolishness...^^You, messenger, listen. I am Ivar Ragnarsson. Men call me Inn Beinlaussi, the Boneless. If Sven Bull Neck has betrayed us and destroyed our reinforcements as you say, I will hunt him down to sacrifice to the gods with the Blood Eagle. But if you're lying, that will be your fate.
; dlga_ragnarssons_10:ragnarssons_11|I apologize for my brothers, messenger. Being locked up here affects us all.
; dlga_ragnarssons_11:ragnarssons_12_1|Do not worry, Jarl Halfdan. I understand this is a difficult situation.
; dlga_ragnarssons_11:ragnarssons_12_2|Hubbi is right. You should go out and kill these dirty Saxons.
; dlga_ragnarssons_11:ragnarssons_12_3|Ivar is right. It would be suicidal, and stupid to go out.
; dlga_ragnarssons_11:ragnarssons_12_4|I'm just a messenger. Ivar's words are not to my liking at all. He should watch his tongue.
dlga_ragnarssons_12_1:ragnarssons_14_1|{s2}
; dlga_ragnarssons_14_1:ragnarssons_14_2|Puf. Another coward tries to win our sympathies. Anyway, Halfdan, do what you want.
; dlga_ragnarssons_14_2:ragnarssons_13|I see that you are an intelligent person, messenger. Well, I guess it's time to send an answer to Bjorn. Tell him that our answer is 'yes.' We will join the meeting he will arrange with the Saxons. We will accept whatever terms they offer, anything to get out of this gods-forsaken hole.
dlga_ragnarssons_12_2:ragnarssons_13_1|{s2}
; dlga_ragnarssons_13_1:ragnarssons_13_2|I like you, messenger. Keep things clear and direct. We two are simple people.
; dlga_ragnarssons_13_2:ragnarssons_13|Well, my brothers may have different views, but this is the answer you shall take to Bjorn. Tell him that our answer is 'yes.' We will join the meeting he will arrange with the Saxons. We will accept whatever terms they offer, anything to get out of this gods-forsaken hole.
; dlga_ragnarssons_12_3:ragnarssons_15_1|{s2}^^That much is obvious, messenger, but I'm glad others see it as clearly as I do.
; dlga_ragnarssons_15_1:ragnarssons_15_2|Be careful whose side you choose, messenger. Ivar is not accommodating even to his friends, whereas I kill all that oppose me.
; dlga_ragnarssons_15_2:ragnarssons_13|Let's calm down here now! Messenger, my brothers may have different views, but this is the answer you shall take to Bjorn. Tell him that our answer is 'yes.' We will join the meeting he will arrange with the Saxons. We will accept whatever terms they offer, anything to get out of this gods-forsaken hole.
dlga_ragnarssons_12_4:ragnarssons_16_1|{s2}
; dlga_ragnarssons_16_1:ragnarssons_16_2|Ha! You are bold, messenger. Few people dare to speak so to Ivar. Just a tip: watch your back from now on. Ha ha!
; dlga_ragnarssons_16_2:ragnarssons_13|Well, I guess it's time to send an answer to Bjorn. Tell him that our answer is 'yes.' We will join the meeting he arranges with the Saxons. We will accept whatever terms they offer, anything to get out of this gods-forsaken hole.
; dlga_ragnarssons_13:ragnarssons_14|Very well, I will go back to Bjorn. Good luck.
; dlga_ragnarssons_13:ragnarssons_15|Hm. I expected some kind of reward as a messenger.
; dlga_ragnarssons_14:close_window|Good luck to you, too. I fear the return will not be as easy as the way in. The Angles of Mierce have seen you and have brought more men into the woods.
; dlga_ragnarssons_15:close_window|Sure! Take this money and our wishes for good luck. I fear the return will not be as easy as the way in. The Angles of Mierce have seen you and have brought more men into the woods.
; dlga_lord_talk:kennemerjarl_muy_angry|{s11}, I saved Doccinga from Sven...
; dlga_kennemerjarl_muy_angry:kennemerjarl_enemistad1|{s2}^^What mission did I give you? Shouldn't you be busy killing the king? And what have you done instead? Went to the aid of Doccinga, knowing that was not going to please me. You killed the very men who were to support me to take the crown after you had killed the king. You have betrayed me, your jarl. I swear upon my name, {s11}, you will pay dearly for it!
; dlga_lord_talk:kennemerjarl_doccingacano|My Lord, Doccinga is going to be attacked by Sven Bull Neck! They need troops.
; dlga_lord_talk:king_doccingacano|Doccinga is going to be attacked by Sven Bull Neck! They need help!
; dlga_lord_talk:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm1|{s11}, I have returned from the Thiaderd mission.
; dlga_lord_talk:kennemerjarl_juicio_1|{s11}, I went back to the monastery and made things right, in your name.
; dlga_lord_talk:kennemerjarl_recruit_back1|{s11}, I have warriors that you asked me for.
; dlga_lord_talk:kennemerjarl_juicio_2|{s11}, I went back to the monastery and made things right, in your name.
; dlga_lord_talk:kinghorik_quest_revenge1|I come from Friese. I need to talk to you about an important issue.
; dlga_lord_talk:kinghorik_quest_thing1|King Horik, we were attacked at Ulf's farm.
; dlga_lord_talk:kinghorik_quest_atlieiriksson1|King Horik, we met Atli Eiriksson.
; dlga_lord_talk:kinghorik_ulf_testigo1|Ulf Thorirsson will not testify against me at the Assembly.
; dlga_lord_talk:kinghorik_thething1|I've done everything. I think I'm ready to go to the Assembly.
; dlga_lord_talk:aethelredbodoletter_1|I have an important letter for you.

; dlga_lord_talk:aelfredbodoletter_1_1|Yes, I've joined West Seaxe and returned, as you requested.

; dlga_lord_talk:raethbarthbodoletter_1|I have an important letter for you.

; dlga_lord_talk:raethbarthbjorn_1|Bjorn sent me back to you.

; dlga_lord_talk:jarlbjornnegtruce_1|The Saxons agree to meet with you to sign a truce.
; dlga_lord_talk:jarlbjornneg_1|I talked to your siblings. They are willing to negotiate with the Saxons.

; dlga_lord_talk:sigurd_quest_revenge_horik0|Sigurd, it's time to talk. I can cause you a lot of damage if you do not listen to me.
; dlga_lord_talk:sigurd_quest_revenge_horik|Sigurd, it's time to talk. I'm not an ordinary man; I have the support of King Horik.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge1:lord_pretalk|I do not care who you are or what your motives may be. Here in Danmark, you're a nobody, someone insignificant. You have neither credentials nor support. I say it only once: get out of my presence, rat.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge_horik0:sigurd_quest_revenge2|{s2}^^I see. I was hoping to avoid this, but I am tired of trying. Your mere presence offends my sight. Of course I know your name, {playername}; {s4} sent me news about you. The {reg59?lady:man} who would kill King Hrorik Hemmingsson and help us take Friese. I was happy to hear this, but then I got more news from the jarl yesterday. '{playername} is a traitor,' said the messenger. 'Be careful. {reg59?She:He} wants Sven Bull Neck and comes to talk to you. {reg59?She:He} has destroyed our plans in Friese, protected Doccinga and killed your Vikings. When you see {reg59?her:him}, kill {reg59?her:him}.' You are perhaps too bold to come here.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge_horik:sigurd_quest_revenge2|{s2}^^You are persistent! I was hoping to avoid this, but you name names... none other than that of King Horik.^^Of course I know your name, {playername}; {s4} sent me news about you. The {reg59?lady:man} who would kill King Hrorik Hemmingsson and help us take Friese. I was happy to hear this, but then I got more news from the jarl yesterday.

; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge2:sigurd_quest_revenge31|My issues are not with you. I just want to find Sven Bull Neck and my mother.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge2:sigurd_quest_revenge32|I did not know the jarl's plans, so I defended Doccinga. I am loyal to your cause.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge31:sigurd_quest_revenge4|How stupid can you be? Sven Bull Neck is not just any man but my favorite, the man who stands in the prow of my own personal ship. You and I have nothing to talk about. Get out now, while my obligation to hear you in peace still weighs down my sword.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge32:sigurd_quest_revenge322|Your loyalty is too strange and too late. You're just the rat that thwarted my plans in Friese. {s4} had promised me six hundred men for the expedition to Englaland. Now I have exactly none.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge322:sigurd_quest_revenge31|Sorry, but I just want to know where Sven Bull Neck is.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge322:sigurd_quest_revenge33|I will recruit six hundred men for you.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge33:lord_pretalk|{s4}^^I do hope you're not teasing me and that it is not Loki speaking with your mouth. Frankly, I doubt you're able to recruit six hundred men, but if you recruit more than two hundred, come back here, and we will talk. Maybe you will get to chat with my friend, Sven.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_collect1:sigurd_quest_collect1|{s2}^^One of my hersirs will take care of your men. Well, now they are MY men. I really did not expect someone like you to be able to do this, but here you are. I see that you will do anything to find Sven Bull Neck and your mother.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_collect1:sigurd_quest_collect2|Yes. Sven Bull Neck attacked the ship on which I was traveling and kidnapped my mother. He had mistaken the person because of an object she was carrying. Sven Bull Neck has to pay for this, and I must rescue my mother.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_collect2:sigurd_quest_revenge5|Your mother is the woman touched by the gods? Yes, Sven brought her to me, as I had asked. She was carrying an object, a letter from overseas that had to be intercepted. I talked to her, yes... She spoke about a man called Bodo, who had given her the letter on a ship called the Woden Ric. So do you know that name?
dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge4:sigurd_quest_revenge41|{s10}

; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge5:sigurd_quest_revenge52|Yes, he was also traveling in the Woden Ric.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge51:sigurd_quest_revenge6|Lying! Why do you lie? You say that you traveled on the same boat with your mother, and she says she met Bodo on the same boat. That man, Bodo, is very important to me, but Sven made the mistake of leaving him in his hideout. Now Bodo is gone because someone rescued him. I suspect I know who this someone is! Bodo is so important, that I would gladly trade him for Sven Bull Neck and you mother, who still lives only because Sven has taken a liking to her.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge52:sigurd_quest_revenge6|I know, your mother told me. That man, Bodo, is very important to me, but Sven made the mistake of leaving him in his hideout. Now Bodo is gone because someone rescued him. I suspect I know who this someone is! Bodo is so important, that I would gladly trade him for Sven Bull Neck and you mother, who still lives only because Sven has taken a liking to her.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge6:sigurd_quest_revenge61|You tell me where Sven Bull Neck and my mother are, and Bodo is yours.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge6:sigurd_quest_revenge62|I do not know where Bodo is.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge61:sigurd_quest_revenge71|Then we have a deal. I suppose Bodo is with you, so I will send two men to get him. You people keep quiet, for I have hundreds of warriors ready to attack on my order. If they take Bodo without complications, there will be no problems. I hope this will be how it goes, for a fight would not benefit any of us.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge71:sigurd_quest_revenge8|{s4}^^As for my part, there is a farm near Skyfa belonging to a man that is loyal to me. Go there, and Sven Bull Neck and your mother will meet you there. {playername}, remember that there are laws in Danmark, and if you cause any damage to Sven, you will have to pay...
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge62:sigurd_quest_revenge72|I'm too old to swallow your lies. Bodo means too much to me, and I know you know where he is. What I do not know is if you have hidden him among your people or elsewhere. So here is the deal:
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge72:sigurd_quest_revenge82|{s4}^^There is a farm near Skyfa belonging to a man that is loyal to me. Go there, and Sven Bull Neck and your mother will meet you there. If Bodo is there, my men will exchange Sven Bull Neck and your mother for him. If Bodo is not there, your mother will die before your eyes, and I will send Sven away to a place where you will never find him.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge8:close_window|Have your men follow me. I will tell Bodo farewell and give him to them.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge82:sigurd_quest_revenge82_1|I will go to that farm near Skyfa. Farewell.
; dlga_sigurd_quest_revenge82_1:close_window|Well, I think we have nothing to talk about.
; dlga_lord_talk:sigurd_story1|I would like to know more about you.
; dlga_sigurd_story1:lord_pretalk|My name is Sigurdr ormr i auga, Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye,' son of Ragnar Lodbrok and Aslaug, lord of Sjaelland, Skane, and other lands. To learn more, ask other men, as fame is measured by what others say about you.
; dlga_lord_talk:kennemerjarl_story1|I would like to know more about you.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_story1:lord_pretalk|There is not much to tell you. I am the son of Harald the Younger and nephew of King Horik. My father with my uncle and Gotrik conquered this land.^One may say that my uncle Hrorik, the king, serves Lothar, king of the Franks, but really, my uncle does what he wants. The only thing is that we should not attack the land of the Franks. This I heed very little, and occasionally I organize some expedition for plunder or pay against the Franks.^^There is no need to talk over my head, and there are more pressing problems, such as the rebellion of some Frisians. My uncle would sooner kill them all, but he is still too weak.
; dlga_lord_talk:kennemerjarl_1|{s11}, Thonkrik from Doccinga told me that you could help me.
; dlga_king_doccingacano:lord_pretalk|I sent men there weeks ago. I will try to send more men soon, but I need to gain time. If you help Doccinga, I will be grateful.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_doccingacano:lord_pretalk|That's neither my problem nor yours. It is the king's problem.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_1:kennemerjarl_2|Thonkrik is a good man, and you are a good friend. What do you need?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_1:kennemerjarl_2.1|Thonkrik is a good man, one of the few Frisians who have gained my esteem. If you come in his name, I will listen to you!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_2:kennemerjarl_3|Do you know the Woden Ric? I traveled on this ship with my mother, but we were attacked by Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_3:kennemerjarl_4|Sven the Bloody attacks merchant ships near our shores, waiting for us to pay him every spring, but not this year! Do not worry. I'm gathering troops to hunt for him. Now, I have things to do...
; dlga_kennemerjarl_4:kennemerjarl_51|I desire to join the hunt. My goal is to avenge the death of my mother.

dlga_kennemerjarl_52:kennemerjarl_6|{s2}
; dlga_kennemerjarl_51:kennemerjarl_6|{s1}^^I am not sure... How many men and ships do you have?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_6:kennemerjarl_71|My arms are my men, and my courage is my ships. Together we will kill Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_6:kennemerjarl_72|In truth, I lost everything, but I do not lack the courage to achieve my revenge.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_6:kennemerjarl_73|I am just one {reg59?woman:man}, sir, but I will give my eternal loyalty to you.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_71:kennemerjarl_8|Yes, yes, I see... Well, look, I'm very busy. Why don't you come see me later? In ten years, for example?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_72:kennemerjarl_8|Well, I understand your desire for revenge, but I cannot help you... I need men and ships ready to fight, not desperate, poorly equipped orphans-in-mourning.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_73:kennemerjarl_8|Your loyalty does not interest me. Tell you what... You look like a good {reg59?woman:man}. Why not ask Thonkrik from Doccinga for {reg59?a good man to marry:a job digging the moat} and try to rebuild your life?
dlga_kennemerjarl_8:kennemerjarl_91|{s10}
; dlga_kennemerjarl_8:kennemerjarl_92|I thought that surely you would understand the demands of honor in cases such as mine.
dlga_kennemerjarl_91:kennemerjarl_92|{s2}
; dlga_kennemerjarl_92:kennemerjarl_93|Are you indeed so motivated by honor? Alright, I can do this: I'll give you a place among the men who will face Sven if you prove your worth.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_93:kennemerjarl_94|{s1}^^There is a problem I need to solve. Not far from here is a monastery of Christians, Odin damn them, who have sent a request to intercede in a land property dispute.^Honestly, I care very little about their problems, but the king wants Christian priests happy, to avoid Frisian rebellions.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_94:kennemerjarl_95|Anyway, my men are busy, protecting important things like the people on the coast, so you go in my name and make the arrangement that best suits my interests.^   The most important thing is to keep the monks quiet. I do not want them stirring up the people versus rightful Danish dominion.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_95:kennemerjarl_10|Thank you, my lord. I will not disappoint you.
dlga_kennemerjarl_95:kennemerjarl_10.1|C'è un premio?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_95:kennemerjarl_10.2|It will be done quickly. Farewell.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_10:lord_pretalk|Are you still here, {reg59?woman:man}? You have a mission! Complete it, and your revenge on Sven will be that much closer. Now, get out!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_1:kennemerjarl_juicio_3|Yes, I know. The monastery sent a messenger with the news. They are happy with your decision and promise to speak well of me to the people. Take this reward, and thank you!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_2:kennemerjarl_juicio_4|Yes, I know. The monastery sent a messenger with the news. They are very unhappy and blame me for sending you. They say that everyone will know that I am unjust! Damn you!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_3:kennemerjarl_juicio_5|What about our deal? May I join the hunt now?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_4:kennemerjarl_juicio_41|No one can think that you are unfair when justice has been done.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_41:kennemerjarl_juicio_42|Oho! A {reg59?lady:gentleman} with values. Justice is all very nice, but this world isn't right and won't recognize it. That land wasn't important, but good relations with monastery are. Do not upset me again.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_42:kennemerjarl_juicio_5|What about our deal? May I join the hunt now?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_5:kennemerjarl_juicio_6_old|Err, not just yet. Now I need you to do something else to prove your worth, this time as a warrior. There is a rebellious Frisian, called Thiaderd, who has been causing me a headache, and I do not have the time right now to take care of him.^^I'll give you permission to recruit on my land. Also, I will send a letter to the king so he may likewise allow you to recruit men in Friese.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_6_old:kennemerjarl_juicio_6_final|This is what I want you to do. Take this silver and recruit fifteen men. The cheapest are village idlers or refugees at the monastery. Sometimes spare men are available at farmsteads. Once you have men, come back here, and I will tell you how to find Thiaderd.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_6_final:lord_pretalk|--He scratches his nose--^^Well, good luck. Now, you have things to do.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_recruit_back1:kennemerjarl_juicio_6_new|Well, you again have proven useful. As I mentioned before, there is a rebellious Frisian called Thiaderd who has been a headache for me. I do not have the time right now to take care of him. You'll do it for me!^^Oh, and here is some money to equip yourself better. I can't allow people to think that I employ such shabby help.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_6_new:kennemerjarl_juicio_61|I like the sound of this.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_6_new:kennemerjarl_juicio_61.1|I do not like what you offer.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_61:kennemerjarl_juicio_7|To tell you the truth, I don't care if you like it or not. You offered your services, and I offered you a job.^Do this for me, and your revenge upon Sven will be closer. Take this money and travel to Dorestad. There is a man there who knows all about this. His name is Reginhard, and I hear that he cowers in the mead hall between the prostitutes and the other drunks.^He would not talk to my men, but maybe you can find out where the rebel is hiding and kill him. Thiaderd must die.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_7:kennemerjarl_juicio_71|It shall be done. Farewell.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_7:kennemerjarl_juicio_71.1|I do not like this mission, but I keep my part of the deal. Farewell.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_71:kennemerjarl_juicio_71_fin|Are you still here? You have a mission! I would see you on it, {reg59?madame:sir}!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_juicio_71_fin:lord_pretalk|--He scratches his nose--
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm1:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm2|I am very happy. The news of Thiaderd's death came before you.^^I must say that I doubted your abilities, but certainly you're smarter than I thought. Moreover, you have proven to be someone trustworthy and loyal. Take this money as compensation for your efforts. It is a pity that you didn't kill Reginhard, too, but I guess you need a pet in your party. However, I do not want him around me, so keep that rat away when you come to see me.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm2:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm3|{s2}^^Well, well... I must confess something. I've been waiting for someone like you for a long time. You are a person that can find solutions and accomplish what is ordered. That is very important. Sometimes I feel like I'm surrounded by dolts.^^Now, there is a delicate subject I want to talk to you about -- one that can make you rich.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm3:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm41|Wealth, I do not care about. I just want Sven.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm3:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm42|I like what I hear! Please continue...
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm41:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm42|That much I know! But the two are related. Listen to the whole story and see for yourself.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm42:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm5|To be honest, I have the men to hunt Sven, who's near Doccinga. I'm hoping that you'll join us in his capture...^However, we have a problem: the king. The king, my uncle, does not want to attack Sven Bull Neck. He fears his master, Jarl Sigurd, called 'Snake in the Eye,' one of the oldest sons of Ragnar, called Lodbrok in Norse -- Hairy Breeches.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm5:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm52|These names say nothing to me. Who are Sigurd and his father, Ragnar? Should I fear them?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm5:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm51|You have kept all this information hidden until now?
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm5:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm6|I am listening. Please continue.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm51:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm6|You must understand, it is not so easy. It is a sensitive issue, and you were a stranger that the sea had just brought to us. Now it's different. I think you're someone I can trust.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm52:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm5|Ragnar Sigurdsson was a man who became a legend, a king who ruled part of Danmark and whose ships caused fear wherever they were spotted. Ragnar died years ago, but he had many sons, many of whom are invading Englaland right now.^Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' Ragnarsson is one of his oldest sons, by the princess Aslaug. He is old now, but still a man to be feared and a respected Danish jarl.^Yes, you should fear him if you do not have the support of a powerful king or jarl. I can be that man if you help me.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm6:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm7|Here is the deal: kill my uncle {s10}, and I will take the kingdom for myself. Then I'll have the necessary resources and men to hunt Sven Bull Neck and attack his master, Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye.' Additionally, I will give you the title of 'jarl' in this land, plus the men and money to be powerful.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm7:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm71|You want to become king, using me? No, I don't trust you! I am not your assassin!
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm7:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm71.1|We had a deal. Thiaderd is dead. Your part is to give me what I need to hunt Sven.

; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm7:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm9|I accept your proposal. I will kill your king.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm71:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm8|No more deals, lies or missions! Just this one condition, and everything will be yours. What is your answer?
dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm74:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm8|{s2}
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm8:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm9|I accept. I will kill {s10}.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm8:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm91|No, you will have to find another assassin. I will hunt Sven Bull Neck on my own.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm9:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm9a|I was sure I would hear that answer, for I have not misled you. {s10} is not just any man. Everyone fears him, not the least because he is always accompanied by an escort of faithful warriors. His death should be public, in the sight of those who fear him. The ideal time would be during a feast. I do not care if you use poison or a dagger, but two things are very important...
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm9a:kennemerjarl_salida|Firstly, if you are caught, do not mention my name. You must appear to be acting alone. Even beforehand, we should not be seen together. If we happen to meet, we must pretend not to know each other.^^Secondly and more importantly, do not get caught!^^Once you are done, do not come here. Hide in the mountains, where Thiaderd's camp was, and I will send for you when things are calm and I am the king. Now go and make me king.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_thiaderdm91:kennemerjarl_thiaderdm91a|You're dumber than I thought. It's quite beyond you, with your resources, to find Sven. Even if you do, he will kill you easily. If you decide to change your mind, remember this: {s10} must die in public, in the sight of those who fear him, ideally at a feast. I do not care if you use poison or a dagger, but two things are very important...

Otherwise, you will have to face the consequences.
dlga_kennemerjarl_salida:lord_pretalk|Molto bene.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_enemistad1:kennemerjarl_enemistad2|Beware, Jarl! Those were Sven's men. You are the traitor, and I am your enemy now.
dlga_kennemerjarl_enemistad1:kennemerjarl_enemistad3|{s10}
; dlga_kennemerjarl_enemistad1:kennemerjarl_enemistad4|I have served you well. In return, you lied to me about Sven, and now you threaten me.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_enemistad2:kennemerjarl_enemistad21|Yes, I'm sure of that. To honor services provided, I will give you a few hours to pack your things and leave. Then you will have assassins after you, for I will put a price on your head. You'll have to sleep with one eye open and a knife under your pillow.^If you do not leave Friese or we meet in person, I will kill you with my bare hands.
; dlga_kennemerjarl_enemistad4:kennemerjarl_enemistad21|Yes. These men were going to take and fortify the village, then wait for more troops from Danmark. Now that's impossible. You've ended my dreams. Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye' will think I'm a traitor and will want my head because of you. Go away! You're no longer welcome here. If we meet again, I do not know if I will be able to control myself and not kill you.^^I recommend you leave Friese.

; dlga_frisaking_4:lord_pretalk|You accuse one of my dearest jarls of treason? I see. Someone is trying to create problems with my jarls and sends me a stranger with rumors. Perhaps they think that I'm an idiot and that I will give credibility to these hoaxes? Listen carefully, rat. Your word is not worth anything. Only evidence is important. Now, get the hell out, and give thanks that I do not separate your head from your neck.
; dlga_jarldenunciado1:jarldenunciado12|Heill, {playername}! I heard about your help to Doccinga. Thank you for your support, vinr. The attack was unexpected, and I did not have my men ready. Please, accept these gifts for your courage.

You're talking about very feared and dangerous people, {playername}. My nephew is reckless and daring, and our kingdom is at a difficult moment with Frisian revolts. He thinks I'm weak for not exterminating the Frisians and attacking the Franks who support them. In fact, we aren't as strong now as in the past. However, I don't think he is a traitor. Do you have evidence?
; dlga_jarldenunciado15:jarldenunciado16|No, but he asked me to kill you.

; dlga_jarlbjornnegtruce_3:lord_pretalk|Well.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_1:jarlbjornneg_2|I can imagine that Halfdan imposed his opinion. I had hoped to be mindful of his reasons and I'm glad I did so.^^Now it is necessary to contact the Saxons. I have prepared a letter for them where we offer a truce to cover our retreat to Northhymbre and to summon them to a meeting outside Snotingaham's gate to discuss the details.^^My informants tell me that one of the Saxon chieftains, Aelfred, patrols around Snotingaham every day. Meet with him and give him my letter.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_2:jarlbjornneg_31|Who is Aelfred?
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_2:jarlbjornneg_32|Why not take the letter to the Mercians? We are in their kingdom.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_2:jarlbjornneg_33|The king of West Seaxe is Aethelred. Why not give the letter to him?
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_31:jarlbjornneg_4|Aelfred, or I should say Aetheling Aelfred Aethelwulfing, is the brother of West Seaxe's king. I have heard that he is a just man and easier to deal with than his brother. Moreover, his opinion carries great weight among the Saxon jarls.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_32:jarlbjornneg_4|Do not kid yourself. The Saxons are the real power here. The Angles of Mierce are very weak. Without the support of West Seaxe, Mierce would be under our feet by now. It will be the Saxons who make the decision to accept the ceasefire or not, and in this case, Aelfred is our man. He is more reasonable than his brother.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_33:jarlbjornneg_4|Aethelred is a warrior, and we need a diplomat. Anyway, in such matters he seeks advice from his brother, Aelfred.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_4:jarlbjornneg_51|Well, I'll be back soon.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_4:jarlbjornneg_52|Humph. I expected a reward for my services.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_51:lord_pretalk|Remember this: when you get to Snotingaham, introduce yourself as a peace emissary from the sons of Ragnar and ask for audience with Aelfred. Tell him we're willing to an honorable way out of this siege without bloodshed, and we are willing to meet at the gates of Snotingaham to address this issue.^^Be firm! Tell him only that we are willing to negotiate, or we will bring more men from the north, and they will pay dearly in lives of Saxons and Mercians. Good luck.
; dlga_jarlbjornneg_52:jarlbjornneg_51|Yes, I quite forgot I was talking to a merchant. I usually reward my faithful with silver as a symbol of our bond, but I understand that you are not that kind of person. Well, here's your prize, and there will be more if you complete your task. Now...
; dlga_jarlbjorn_1:jarlbjorn_2|My brother, Sigurd, promised us a thousand men. Where are they?
; dlga_jarlbjorn_2:jarlbjorn_3|They are dead or lost. Sigurd Ragnarsson, under orders of the Assembly, sent a fleet led by Sven Bull Neck and Harald Haraldsson, but Sven pitted his followers against the followers of Harald, and there was a massacre. I fear that Harald's followers are all dead but me, and Sven's are severely depleted.
; dlga_jarlbjorn_3:jarlbjorn_4|{s2}^^Sven was always difficult to handle, so I never understood Sigurd's predilection for him. Now this puts us in a difficult situation here in Snotingaham. If I ever meet Sven again, I will kill him with my bare hands. We are at a disadvantage compared to the men of West Seaxe and Mierce. So far, we have managed to keep them at bay thanks to our reputation, but every day they become more daring and eventually will storm Snotingaham. Then all will be lost. We have to restore their fear in order to make a deal that will let our people escape Snotingaham. Without reinforcements, retreat is the only option.
; dlga_jarlbjorn_4:jarlbjorn_5_1|I thought Englaland would be an easy target for a Viking army.
dlga_jarlbjorn_4:jarlbjorn_5_2|{s10}
; dlga_jarlbjorn_5_1:jarlbjorn_5_3|West Seaxe and Mierce are two powerful kingdoms, which makes nothing easy. We need many more men before facing them, especially now that both kings have united against us. Luckily, these alliances are fleeting. If we retreat now and focus our interest on weaker kingdoms, there will be another opportunity to go against Mierce or even West Seaxe. For now, there's always Pictland, poor, stony prospect though it be!
dlga_jarlbjorn_5_3:jarlbjorn_5_2|{s10}
dlga_jarlbjorn_5_2:jarlbjorn_6|{s4}
; dlga_jarlbjorn_6:jarlbjorn_7|This land is rich, and its people fear us. That fear is what now keeps them from attacking us, but they are losing it. We must regain the initiative.^^West Seaxe, especially, has become very bold, and Saxon foragers even get close to our lines. There is a group there now, around Snotingaham. I want you to go and punish them. This will send a clear message to our enemies and undermine their confidence.
; dlga_jarlbjorn_7:jarlbjorn_9|I see. Very well, I'll take care of them.
; dlga_jarlbjorn_7:jarlbjorn_8|Why should I do this?
; dlga_jarlbjorn_8:jarlbjorn_9|Because you have come to reinforce this army. I am the chief here, and I give you an order.
; dlga_jarlbjorn_9:jarlbjorn_9_pre|When you're done with these men, come back here.
; dlga_jarlbjorn_9_pre:lord_pretalk|I always reward warriors who do their job well.
; dlga_jarlbjornwf_1:jarlbjornwf_2|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those foragers the punishment they deserved.  You are really as good as I had guessed.  Here is your reward: 900 peningas.
; dlga_jarlbjornwf_2:jarlbjornwf_3|I think you're someone who knows how to do things. It's time to take another step. I want you to pass through the enemy lines and take a message to my brothers. Tell them about the betrayal of Sven and that we will not have reinforcements from Danmark. Tell them I'm going to arrange a meeting with the Saxons to negotiate our retreat from Snotingaham.
; dlga_jarlbjornwf_3:jarlbjornwf_4|I go now.
; dlga_jarlbjornwf_3:jarlbjornwf_4_1|Why would your brothers believe me and accept surrender?
; dlga_jarlbjornwf_4_1:jarlbjornwf_4|Because I'll give you an object that they will recognize and give validity to you as my envoy to them. I am Bjorn, of the sons of Ragnar, and my brothers listen to what I say. Do not worry. They will listen to and respect you.
; dlga_jarlbjornwf_4:close_window|Wait. I'm going to give you a seax that belonged to our father, Ragnar. This is also my gift to you for the service you're providing to us. My brothers will recognize the weapon and listen to your words. The Mercians are more careless in their vigilance. Try to approach at night around their flank. Good luck.
; dlga_raethbarth_1:raethbarth_2|Judging by your face, I'm afraid the news is not good, but please speak.
; dlga_raethbarth_2:raethbarth_3|I have bad news about the Vikings sent from Danmark in support of the Ragnarssons' invasion of Mercia. The fleet initially consisted of 30 boats and about 800 men, but Sven Bull Neck pitted his followers against the followers of Harald Haraldsson, and there was a massacre. I fear that Sven will lie to you, but you will see that he will bring considerably less men, many of them wounded from the fight.
; dlga_raethbarth_3:raethbarth_4|{s2}^^Sven Bull Neck is the man that stands in the prow of my brother Sigurd's langskip. Your accusations are serious. However, we have not heard anything about the fleet or Sven so far. These men sent from Danmark are crucial to win the battle against the Saxons in Snotingaham. Without them, we are in a difficult situation.
; dlga_raethbarth_4:raethbarth_5|For now, I cannot do anything else. I need you and your men to come to Bjorn near Snotingaham. Any reinforcement is better than none. Bjorn is my brother and has led men to support my other brothers besieged in Mierce: Halfdan, Ivarr and Hubbi. You will find him camped north of the town. All the support you can lend will be welcome. Meanwhile, I promise you that I will investigate this matter of the fleet and Sven's treason. If he is guilty, he will pay with his life.
; dlga_raethbarth_5:raethbarth_6_1|No, you mustn't kill him. Sven is mine.
; dlga_raethbarth_5:raethbarth_6_2|I see. Kill him.
; dlga_raethbarth_5:raethbarth_6_3|There is a woman with Sven Bull Neck. I do not want anything to happen to her.
; dlga_raethbarth_6_1:lord_pretalk|So, I see this is personal for you. If Sven is guilty, I will give him to you so you can deal with him.
; dlga_raethbarth_6_2:lord_pretalk|That's exactly what will happen if he is guilty. I do not tolerate traitors.
; dlga_raethbarth_6_3:lord_pretalk|So be it. If Sven is guilty, I'll take care of him and keep the woman safe until you return.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_1:raethbarthbodoletter_2|This is the letter that your brother Sigurd tried so earnestly to get. I will give it to you, transcribed and decoded, so you can understand the seriousness of the danger you're facing.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_2:raethbarthbodoletter_3|{s2}^^You are a great friend of the Danish, and especially the sons of Ragnar. I must say that I knew of the existence of the alliance that unites West Seaxe, Asturias and Frankia, but I hadn't known that they had come so far. Asturias is going to send ships and men, and not any men but veterans of the wars with the Moors.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_3:raethbarthbodoletter_4|{s3}^^Frankia may have also mobilized men and ships. If West Seaxe receives these men, it will change the balance of power across the north. Sorry, I'm thinking out loud. Take this reward for serving me so well.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_4:raethbarthbodoletter_51|Thank you. Could I do anything else to help?
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_4:raethbarthbodoletter_52|I could go to Friese and learn about the Franks' movements.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_4:raethbarthbodoletter_53|I could destroy the warriors from Asturias.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_4:raethbarthbodoletter_54|I have to take care of Sven. Is there any news of him?
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_51:raethbarthbodoletter_6|{s2}^^You are helping us a lot already. I really do not know how to thank you. You know that I sent men to discover the whereabouts of Sven Bull Neck. He will pay for what he did... Now I ask you something else...
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_52:raethbarthbodoletter_6|I'm not sure we can get information in Friese. It might be best to go Frankia directly... but this is something we cannot decide right now, you and me.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_53:raethbarthbodoletter_6|{s2}^^My brother Bjorn could tell you some stories about the warriors of Asturias, and even in Al-Andalus, where he lost most of his ships. We are talking about 600 men versed in war. You should give up this matter.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_54:raethbarthbodoletter_6|I have sent men to look for Sven Bull Neck in every corner of Englaland. I can tell you that he survived his battle with Harald Haraldsson, but has not been seen since. Some say he's traveling south with his men.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_6:raethbarthbodoletter_91|I will send a messenger to my brother, Jarl Halfdan Ragnarsson, for a meeting. We will discuss this letter and make a decision soon. Meanwhile, go yourself to talk to the him and offer him your allegiance. You are a person of great ability. You must enter the service of Northhymbre for us to reward you fully as you deserve.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_91:lord_pretalk|Halfdan is a clever man who will appreciate your worth.^^After that, return to me, for I already have a task for you..
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_1_1:raethbarthbodoletter_7|Ah, {playername}. I am honored that you have joined us. Now, as I mentioned, I already have something to ask of you.^^ I need you go north, to the territory of the Kingdom of Alban. The Picts never cease to cause us problems, and we need someone to punish them.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_7:raethbarthbodoletter_81|What is it you need done?
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_7:raethbarthbodoletter_82|I'm sorry. My priority is Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_81:raethbarthbodoletter_9|I want to secure our rear. We cannot take any action against the south, Asturians or Franks if the Picts can raise an army and attack Jorvik.^Recruit an army and conquer Dun Taruo. Keep it in your power for at least twenty days, so that Alban will think that we plan to attack the heart of their kingdom. If you want to keep it, it's yours, but we need thirty days to secure a deal with Alban.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_82:raethbarthbodoletter_81|I promised you Sven Bull Neck, so he will be yours, but I need time to find him. I will have more resources and time if you can help me in this matter.
; dlga_raethbarthbodoletter_9:close_window|Good luck. When you've accomplished your mission, I'm sure I can give you an answer on Sven Bull Neck and about what I decide with my brothers.
; dlga_raethbarthbjorn_1:close_window|Glad to hear that everything went well. Come back in a few days and talk.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_1:raethbarth_wp_2|I am pleased to hear that. The Picts are warlike people, and I was not sure you made it.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_2:raethbarth_wp_3|I have good news for you, too. Sven Bull Neck was seen in East Engle. I guess he has been there because it's a kingdom that gave us supplies, horses and support when we first got to Englaland -- mostly out of fear on the part of their weak king. East Engle is a land that belongs to us by his weakness.^^The bad part is that by now Sven Bull Neck has left East Engle for West Seaxe. He is trying to run away from you. As he must know I have your back, he has sought out the strongest enemy we have.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_3:raethbarth_wp_41|Still, I do not understand why he betrayed Sigurd.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_3:raethbarth_wp_5|I must go to West Seaxe immediately.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_41:raethbarth_wp_42|{s2}^^I think I can answer that. A messenger from my brother Sigurd came to us shortly after your arrival -- unfortunately too late. Sigurd told us that we had to be careful with Sven Bull Neck. Apparently, someone killed his brother, Olvir White Hair, very dear to Sven, and the Assembly will not punish the guilty party. Sven thought that Sigurd had broken his word to him by not defending his right to revenge. So just before leaving with the fleet, Sven Bull Neck renounced his oath to Sigurd and promised to take revenge on his own.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_42:raethbarth_wp_43|I am the one who killed Olvir, but I did it in self-defense.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_42:raethbarth_wp_43.1|I am the one who killed Olvir. He was a dog that deserved what he got.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_42:raethbarth_wp_5|(Say nothing)
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_43:raethbarth_wp_5|The messenger did not mention your name in his story, but I imagine there are many troubles between you and Sven. That can only end in blood.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_5:raethbarth_wp_6|As a result, Sven Bull Neck is now an outlaw and an enemy of the Danish -- especially the sons of Ragnar. However, West Seaxe is a strong and large kingdom. Sven Bull Neck could just hide there, and you would never find him. However, he has two things that West Seaxe needs -- ships and good sailors -- so I think I know where they will send him.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_6:raethbarth_wp_71|To meet the ships from the Kingdom of Asturias and to lead them to West Seaxe. Right?
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_6:raethbarth_wp_72|Tell me what you know.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_6:raethbarth_wp_73|Where he goes, I will go to seek him.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_71:raethbarth_wp_72|{s2}^^I like the people who serve me to be smart. You're absolutely right.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_73:raethbarth_wp_72|This obsession is your bane...
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_72:raethbarth_wp_8|During the time you were busy in the Kingdom of Alban I met with my brothers, and we sent fast ships south for more information. Almost certainly, the Asturian fleet has left port. The letter you gave us mentioned that they are meeting with people sent from West Seaxe in Frankia, in a village called Douar-an-Enez. There is a man called Bodo, once your companion, who is now with the Saxons, so we must assume that the Saxons have the same information as we do. My feeling is that West Seaxe will send Sven Bull Neck and Bodo to Douar-an-Enez soon, if they have not already done so.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_8:raethbarth_wp_91|Bodo will not work with Sven. He hates him as much as I do.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_8:raethbarth_wp_9|Then I must go to Douar-an-Enez.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_91:raethbarth_wp_9|Maybe. I do not know so well as you this Bodo, but now he is not with you but with our enemies, and I know that you ended well with him. We cannot take the risk.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_9:raethbarth_wp_10|These men from Asturias are very important, and we could use them on our side against West Seaxe. There is a traitor among them, a man named Silo, who was a prisoner of my brother Bjorn when he was in those lands. Bjorn freed him after earning his loyalty. That man has been passing us information in exchange for silver, much silver. Use Silo to gain favor with the Asturians, to pit them against West Seaxe and join us. But if you fail to convince them, kill them all.
; dlga_raethbarth_wp_10:close_window|Finish everything you have pending, as you will be out several weeks. We have gathered men and have prepared ships for them. They await you in {s3}. Ask the old captain at the port. He is the man who deals with hiring sailors. Above all, remember that it is very important that this Asturian army never helps West Seaxe.
; dlga_aethelredbodoletter_1:lord_pretalk|A letter? I am not a scribe. Talk to my brother Aelfred.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_1:aelfredbodoletter_2|This is the letter that old 'Snake in the Eye' so earnestly tried to get. My partner, Bodo, brought it here from Asturias. It proposes to send an army from Asturias, around the coast of Frankia, to West Seaxe, under the terms of the alliance. The blood of many innocents stains this letter, particularly that of the passengers of the Woden Ric, the boat where this matter started. I hope that their sacrifice will save other lives.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_2:aelfredbodoletter_2_1|{s2}^^.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_2_1:aelfredbodoletter_3|--From where you are, you can hear nothing, but you can see their lips move as Bodo gestures to put emphasis on his words. Aelfred remains calm, patiently listening and questioning. He is a young man, short and slight, but he reputedly has a hot temper that he hides very well. Finally, both return to your side.--
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_3:aelfredbodoletter_4|{playername}, West Seaxe thanks you for bringing this letter. Bodo has told me everything, and I know all the hardships you've been through because of this mission and, even more personally, the kidnapping of your mother. How may we reward you?
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_4:aelfredbodoletter_51|Doing the right thing is reward enough for me.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_4:aelfredbodoletter_52|I do have a request. Help me find a Dane called Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_4:aelfredbodoletter_53|I want you to help me find a Dane called Sven Bull Neck and expect a suitable reward.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_4:aelfredbodoletter_54|I did this for Bodo. I do not expect a reward.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_51:aelfredbodoletter_6|{s2}^^This is not very common: selfless people willing to help for the sake of doing good. I am sure that God, our Father, who sees everything, is saving a place in paradise for you.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_52:aelfredbodoletter_6|West Seaxe has informants across Englaland. If Sven Bull Neck appears somewhere, soon we'll know. As soon as I know something, I'll let you know.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_53:aelfredbodoletter_6|{s2}^^I see. Take this silver. About Sven Bull Neck, West Seaxe has informants across Englaland. If Sven Bull Neck appears somewhere, soon we'll know.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_54:aelfredbodoletter_6|Well, friendship is one of the most cherished virtues among the Saxons. By helping him, you have helped West Seaxe. Take this reward and know that as soon as we know anything of the whereabouts of Sven Bull Neck, we'll let you know.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_6:aelfredbodoletter_91|I will send a messenger to my brother, the king, for a meeting. We will discuss this letter and make a decision soon.^^Meanwhile, go yourself to talk to the king and offer him your allegiance. You are a person of great ability. You must enter the service of West Seaxe for us to reward you fully as you deserve.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_91:close_window|My brother is a good man. I am sure he will accept you.^^After that, return to me, for I already have a task for you.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_1_1:aelfredbodoletter_7|Ah, {playername}. I am honored that you have joined us. Now, as I mentioned, I already have something to ask of you.^^We have received repeated requests from the lands of the Welsh for help. Things are very hectic there. Because of our confrontation with the Danish, we were unable to give the attention the problem deserves. I want you go there on behalf of West Seaxe and impose peace.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_7:aelfredbodoletter_81|What you need me to do?
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_7:aelfredbodoletter_82|I am sorry. My priority is Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_82:aelfredbodoletter_81|You can be sure that, when you return from this mission, we will have news about Sven Bull Neck for you. Sven Bull Neck is a man known for his outbursts of rage, so our informers will soon hear something.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_81:aelfredbodoletter_9|I want you go there and take a fortress called Din Bych. Put your flag there for twenty days to demonstrate to the Welsh that we are ready to take their land by force if they are not able to keep peace among themselves.
; dlga_aelfredbodoletter_9:lord_pretalk|Good luck. The first time we met in Snotingaham, I never thought that you would be important to West Seaxe, but now you've done us a big favor.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_1:aethelred_wp_2|I am pleased to hear that. The Welsh are warlike people, and I was not sure you made it.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_2:aethelred_wp_3|I have good news for you, too. Sven Bull Neck was spotted in East Engle. I guess he was there because that kingdom gave the Danish supplies, horses and support when they first arrived in Englaland. It's a poor kingdom with a king whose weakness only helped the plague that has fallen upon us.^^The bad part is that Sven Bull Neck has since left East Engle and now serves Northhymbre. He is trying to run away from you. As he must know that West Seaxe has received you, he surrounds himself with our enemies.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_3:aethelred_wp_41|Still, I do not understand why they give them shelter when he killed King Horik's man.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_3:aethelred_wp_5|Then I must go to Northhymbre.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_41:aethelred_wp_42|{s2}^^The sons of Ragnar rule Northhymbre, not the king of Danmark, Horik, and from what I know, Sven Bull Neck is the prow man of Sigurd 'Snake in the Eye,' one of the most dangerous of the Ragnarssons.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_42:aethelred_wp_43|Someday Sigurd and I will settle our accounts.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_42:aethelred_wp_43.1|Sigurd may be in Danmark, but he has long arms.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_42:aethelred_wp_5|(Say nothing)
; dlga_aethelred_wp_43:aethelred_wp_5|I think you, Sven and Sigurd have many problems among you, and this can only end in blood.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_5:aethelred_wp_6|Well, Sven Bull Neck is a problem, but Northhymbre is full of Danes, and they are strong. Sven Bull Neck could just hide there, and you would never find him. However, the Ragnarssons need him to prove his worth. I think I know where they will send him.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_6:aethelred_wp_71|To meet the ships from the Kingdom of Asturias and destroy them. Right?
; dlga_aethelred_wp_6:aethelred_wp_72|Tell me what you know.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_6:aethelred_wp_73|Wherever he goes, I will go and find him.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_71:aethelred_wp_72|{s2}^^I like that the people who serve be smart. You're right.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_73:aethelred_wp_72|This obsession must be giving you headaches...
; dlga_aethelred_wp_72:aethelred_wp_8|During the time you were busy with the Welsh, I met with my brother. Almost certainly, the Asturian fleet has left port. The letter you gave us mentioned that they will meet our people in Frankia, near a village called Douar-an-Enez. I fear that, in some way, the sons of Ragnar have obtained this information.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_8:aethelred_wp_91|A man, Reginhard, betrayed me. Perhaps he mentioned this to Sigurd.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_8:aethelred_wp_9_1|I remember Sigurd mentioned a traitor in Asturias. Somebody called Silo.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_91:aethelred_wp_9|Maybe. It shows your poor judgment when it comes to choosing companions.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_9:aethelred_wp_9_1|That's not fair! I remember Sigurd mentioned a traitor in Asturias. Perhaps the information came to them from there.
; dlga_aethelred_wp_9_1:aethelred_wp_10|If there is a traitor in the fleet of the Kingdom of Asturias, you must find and kill him. These men from Asturias are very important.

; dlga_aelfred_ad_1:aelfred_ad_2|{s3}^^Yes, it's true. The news preceded you. It seems that the Danish surprised you. The army was lost, the best that we had right now, and all this work and diplomatic expense has been for nothing.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_2:aelfred_ad_31|I admit my failure.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_2:aelfred_ad_32|Thanks to my victory in Douar-an-Enez, you have 600 Danish less attacking West Seaxe.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_31:aelfred_ad_4|{s2}^^Look, it's not worth worrying about what could be and was not. Now we have problems that are more serious.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_32:aelfred_ad_4|{s2}^^I would not call it a victory. The news I received was that there was dissension in the camp of the Asturians. I distinctly remember asking you neutralize the traitor as soon as possible. If you had followed my instruction, you would have defeated the Danish and today we would have 500 veterans here to help. Well, forget it. Now we have problems that are more serious.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_4:aelfred_ad_5|We are in dire straits. The Danish became strong in Readingum, and they resisted our attempt to drive them away. My brother, King Aethelred, is convinced that God was not on our side and is trying to regain his favor by praying as much as he can. I think we need more men AND God's favor to defeat the Danish. That's why I was so desperate to see you. Ahm, did I say 'desperate?' Well, I meant I need your help, for you have proven to be a resourceful {reg59?lady:man}.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_5:aelfred_ad_6|{s2}^^The Danish are preparing to advance to our meeting. They know that if we are defeated, West Seaxe will be at their mercy, and they will do the same thing here that they did in East Engle and Northhymbre. After the defeat at Readingum, many men were scattered, and I sent out thegns to gather them and also to raise the fyrd in the villages to cover our losses. We need food to feed all these people. I need you to bring me {reg3} head of cattle so I can keep the troops fed. I care very little about where you get them. Just bring them to me as soon as you can.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_6:aelfred_ad_71|Well, I'll get the cattle while you gather your men. It's time to end the Danish.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_6:aelfred_ad_72|I'm tired of being a peon for West Seaxe.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_6:aelfred_ad_73|Sven was not in Douar-an-Enez. I cannot take search for cattle; I have to find him.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_71:lord_pretalk|Well, I knew I could count on you.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_72:aelfred_ad_74|Look, I'm usually not so expressive, but I will tell you that you are very important to West Seaxe. I understand that none of this is easy. Moreover, Sven Bull Neck is in the enemy army. Fighting on our side is the best way to reach him. Well, do something! West Seaxe needs you because we are in a situation of life or death, so we will reward you for this service. I'll pay 10,000 peningas from my own treasure. Do you agree?
; dlga_aelfred_ad_73:aelfred_ad_74|Sven Bull Neck is among our enemies, ready to pillage West Seaxe. That makes our interests coincide. Well, West Seaxe needs you in any case because we are in a life or death situation. We will reward you for this service. I'll pay 10,000 peningas from my own treasure. Do you agree?
; dlga_aelfred_ad_74:aelfred_ad_71|Your money is not necessary. I will do this to have your support to hunt to Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_74:aelfred_ad_75|Glad to know that I will be rewarded at last. Pay me, and I'll bring you cattle.
; dlga_aelfred_ad_75:lord_pretalk|Take your money. Now bring the cattle. Good luck.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_1:aelfred_bt_2|{s3}^^The Danish have gotten underway. They are approaching quickly. My brother is praying for victory, and we're ready. If God is on our side, we will win and save West Seaxe. Otherwise, we perish. I do not say such things very often, but thank you for everything, {playername}, especially for joining your destiny to ours.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_2:aelfred_bt_31|Do not worry, sir. Danish are the ones who should be afraid of us.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_2:aelfred_bt_32|Soon Sven and I will see each other and finish what he started on the Woden Ric.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_2:aelfred_bt_33|Thanks are not necessary. It is a pleasure to serve you.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_31:close_window|Well said. They will pay dearly for their ill-considered invasion. Now let's go to the men.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_32:close_window|Sure, we'll help you with that! Now let's go to the men.
; dlga_aelfred_bt_33:close_window|Do you always say what others want to hear? Leave it. Now let's go to the men.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_1:halfdan_ad_2|{s3}^^Yes, it's true. The news preceded you. It seems that the Saxons surprised you. Fortunately, you got the win and ended up with the enemy army. The Danish are in debt to you, {playername}. Let me reward you!
; dlga_halfdan_ad_2:halfdan_ad_31|It was a tough battle, and there were many casualties.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_2:halfdan_ad_32|Thanks to my victory today, the Saxons have many men less to defend West Seaxe.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_31:halfdan_ad_4|{s2}^^Now they enjoy the pleasures of Walhalla. Do not weep for the dead; they do not want to hear it.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_32:halfdan_ad_4|{s2}^^Yes, fate smiles upon us. The Norns weave the threads in our favor. We Danes hold East Engle and Northhymbre, and will soon add West Seaxe, and you, my friend, have become part of the fate of the sons of Ragnar. If my father had known you, he would have adopted you.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_4:halfdan_ad_5|Well, let's deal with the important things. Soon we leave Readingum to attack the Saxons. With every day that passes, they receive more men and become stronger. We must attack them and destroy them quickly. Then West Seaxe will be ours. They are afraid of us, very afraid, but Saxons are bold people with a strong king, not like those Angles. We will precipitate the battle and kill their king, along with that Aelfred, brother of the king, who is equally or more dangerous though he is little more than a boy.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_5:halfdan_ad_6|{s2}^^More immediately, we need meat for our warriors. I need you to bring me {reg3} head of cattle so I can keep the troops fed. I care very little about where you get them. Just bring them to me as soon as you can.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_6:halfdan_ad_71|Well, I'll get the cattle. I will kill Sven and take my share of the booty in West Seaxe.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_6:halfdan_ad_72|Do not take so many liberties. We are not friends.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_6:halfdan_ad_73|Sven was not in Douar-an-Enez. I cannot look for cattle; I have to find Sven Bull Neck.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_71:close_window|Now you're talking! Hurry up! I want to get going soon.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_72:halfdan_ad_74|Oh, I see. You think like a Viking now. I can pay for the service you give. I will give you 8000 peningas now. Do you agree?
; dlga_halfdan_ad_73:halfdan_ad_74|Sven Bull Neck is with our enemies, ready to defend West Seaxe. That makes our interests coincide. Well, I will reward you for this service. I'll pay 8000 peningas. Do you agree?
; dlga_halfdan_ad_74:halfdan_ad_71|Do not worry about the money; it is not necessary. It was but a joke! I'm really with you.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_74:halfdan_ad_75|Glad to know that I will be rewarded at last. Pay me, and I'll bring cattle.
; dlga_halfdan_ad_75:close_window|Take your money. Now bring the cattle. Good luck.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_1:halfdan_bt_2|{s3}^^Everything is ready. It's time to get going. If West Seaxe falls, Englaland will be finished, and our people will take these fertile lands for themselves. We'll all be rich men, and our fame will rival of the heroes of the sagas, {playername}.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_2:halfdan_bt_31|West Seaxe is waiting!
; dlga_halfdan_bt_2:halfdan_bt_32|Soon Sven and I will see each other and finish what he started on the Woden Ric.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_2:halfdan_bt_33|I'm ready to shake the roots of Yggdrasill.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_31:close_window|Well said! Now let's go to the men.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_32:close_window|You should forget this obsession you have! It is your bane. Now let's go to the men.
; dlga_halfdan_bt_33:close_window|That sounds poetic! You must have the soul of a skald, seidr's son! Now let's go to the men.
; dlga_ashdown_2petition:lord_pretalk|Collect all the men that you can and come see me when you're ready.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting1_1:svenbn_hunting1|We owe you a lot, my people and I. When you finish your vendetta with Sven, you will always have a place back here with us.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting1:svenbn_hunting2|Aelfred, without your initiative, this victory would not have been possible.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting1:svenbn_hunting2.1|This victory was the work of all, Halfdan.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:svenbn_hunting21|Again, Sven Bull Neck escapes.
; dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:svenbn_hunting22|A good fight! I'll finish with Sven and return to you with the spoils.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting2:svenbn_hunting3|Well, let us leave compliments for another time. Now I go to gather men. The enemy is not completely defeated and we have to exploit this victory.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting21:svenbn_hunting3|That's over. My men have control of Readingum. Now I go to gather men. The enemy is not completely defeated and we have to exploit this victory.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting22:svenbn_hunting3|We'll be waiting. Now, do not delay but go to meet Sven. Now I go to gather men. The enemy is not completely defeated and we have to exploit this victory.
; dlga_svenbn_hunting3:close_window|Good luck, {playername}, broedr. I never knew anyone with your luck or your destiny. Surely, you're soguligr, a worthy subject for sagas. Far thu vel!
; dlga_svenbn_hunting3:close_window.1|Good luck, {playername}. God is with you, because without His help it would be impossible that someone might do the deeds that you have done. Wes gesund!

; dlga_lord_collect_taxes_success:lord_pretalk|Well done, {playername}, very well done indeed! You were truly the right {reg59?person:man} for the job.

Non sono incline a rompere questa tradizione senza una vera buona ragione. Se darete prova delle vostre capacità in battaglia, potrete giurare fedeltà a me e divenire mio vassallo. Potremo allora discutere di come ottenere un castello.
dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.1|Hmm...Solo i fedeli vassalli di {s10} hanno il diritto di possedere terre e castelli. Mentre i Re qualche volta accettano il vassallaggio da uomini che hanno dato prova di se stessi in battaglia, e donano loro una terra, non ho mai sentito di un Re che abbia concesso feudi ad una donna. Fareste meglio a discutere di questa faccenda direttamente con {s10}.
; dlga_lord_mercenary_elaborate_castle:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1.2|Only my loyal vassals can own lands and castles in my realm. A mercenary cannot be trusted with such a responsibility. However, after serving for some time, you can swear homage to me and become my vassal. Then you will be rewarded with a fief.

The village leader gave a vague description of their leader, and I have put a bounty together. If you can hunt them down and destroy them, I would most certainly be very happy about it.
dlga_lord_quest_mmen:lord_quest_mmen1|Va bene, lo farò.
dlga_lord_quest_mmen1:close_window|Molto bene. La banda potrebbe anche aver lasciato la zona, ma è probabile che saranno individuati da altri viaggiatori lungo la loro strada.
dlga_lord_quest_mmen:lord_mission_rejected|Mi spiace, ma al momento non posso accettare quest'incombenza.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:destroy_lair_quest_brief|Si, c'è qualcosa che potreste fare per me. Ho ricevuto il rapporto che un gruppo di {s4} hanno stabilito una base in quest'area, e stanno attaccando i viaggiatori. Se riuscite a trovare il loro covo e a distruggerlo, ve ne sarei molto grato.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner|Mio {s11}, {s13}, è stato fatto prigioniero da {s14} del {s15}. Normalmente, nobili onorevoli garantiscono ai prigionieri del gentil sangue il privilegio della parola d'onore, e li trattano come ospiti di riguardo poichè rispettano la loro promessa che non proveranno a scappare, fino a quando il ricatto non sarà pagato. Ma {s14}, invece di concedere a {s13} la parola d'onore, ha rinchiuso mio {s11} nelle sue segrete, senza dubbio con la speranza che possa chiedere un riscatto maggiore.

dlga_lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak:lord_mission_rescue_prisoner_method_prisonbreak_2|Ho discusso quest'idea con alcuni dei miei uomini. Una persona potrebbe entrare a {s24}, sotto mentite spoglie o apertamente, poi camminare fino alla guardia della prigione e provare a sottrargli le chiavi con la forza. Tuttavia uscire potrebbe essere difficile. La guarnigione può essere lenta a reagire, ma anche così, si rischia di dover combattere una mezza dozzina o più di nemici tutti in una volta, in uno spazio ristretto per manovrare.

; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told|Oh, {playername}, there is a delicate matter. I need you to take a message to my... to {s3}. Do you think you could do me this little favor? {s33}

; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told.3|Oh, I fear I may never see my {s17}, {s13}, again... He is a prisoner in the dungeon of {s14}. We have tried to negotiate his ransom, but it has been set too high. We can never hope to raise that much money without selling everything we own, and God knows {s13} would rather spend his life in prison than make us destitute. Instead, I came up with a plan to get him out of there, but it requires someone to make a great sacrifice, and so far, my pleas have fallen on deaf ears...
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_mission_told.4|Il mio povero {s11}, {s13}, è imprigionato nelle segrete di {s14}. L'unico modo di poter comunicare tra noi è inviarci lettere ogni volta che possiamo, ma il viaggio è così pericoloso che abbiamo poche possibilità di farlo. Vi prego, vorreste consegnarne una lettera per me?
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_quest_duel_for_lady|Oh {playername}, siete gentile a chiederlo, ma non conoscete i miei problemi, ed io non posso chiedervi di rischiare al posto mio.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2|Ditemi qual è i problema , così che possa prendere la mia decisione.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_2:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3|Molto bene, come desiderate... Mio marito si è fatto alcuni nemici nella sua vita, {playername}. Uno dei più pericolosi è {s13}. Sta lanciando in giro orribili accuse contro di me, attaccando il mio onore ogni volta che ne ha modo! Poichè non può attaccare mio marito direttamente, egli mi sta usando come bersaglio per cercare di macchiare il nostro onore. Dovreste sentire che cose disgustose ha detto! Vorrei solo che ci fosse qualcuno con coraggio sufficiente da fargli rimangiare le sue calunnie, ma {s13} è un ottimo spadaccino, ed è molto temuto...
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted|Non lo temo, {s65}. Gli farò rimangiare le sue menzogne.
dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_accepted:close_window|Oh! Non posso chiedervi ciò, {playername}, ma... Sarò per sempre in debito con voi, e sembrate mostrare una tale sicurezza... Significherebbe molto se voi voleste difendere il mio onore. Grazie mille, tutte le mie preghiere ed il mio favore vanno a voi.
; dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3:lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected|If he is that dangerous, perhaps maybe it would be better to ignore him...
; dlga_lady_quest_duel_for_lady_3_rejected:close_window|Oh... Perhaps you're right, {playername}. I should let go of these silly childhood ideas of chivalry and courage. {reg59?People:Men} are not like that, not anymore. Good day to you.
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_ask_for_quest_past|Well, {playername}, there is a delicate matter that I am not sure how to solve. I have been having nightmares lately...
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past:lady_ask_for_quest_past2|You can count on me, my lady. Your secret is safe with me.
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past:lady_mission_rejected|Nightmares? Hmm. Well, good luck with that.
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past2:lady_ask_for_quest_past3|Well, {playername}, when I was younger, many years ago, there was a very handsome young guard in our castle. I had never seen anyone so handsome. Long story short, we fell in love, and..., well, we became lovers. But then I was married off to my husband, and my love was sent away. I have never seen him again. I have always suspected that either my father or my husband or both of them learned about our affair and sent him to die somewhere, or just hired an assassin to kill him. It was many years ago, but suddenly I started having these dreams in which he is calling me, asking me to go with him and saying that my husband is the one who murdered him. But many years have passed, and I don't feel the infatuation anymore. He's dead, and I'm not, so how can I join him, anyway? Is he a ghost now, asking me to die to join him?
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past3:lady_ask_for_quest_past4|No need to worry, my lady. I will deal with this 'ghost.' Where exactly is he calling you?
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past3:lady_mission_rejected|Sorry, I can't help you with that.
; dlga_lady_ask_for_quest_past4:close_window|He seems to be somewhere around {s33}. Oh, {playername}, I am so grateful. But, please, I beg you, be very discrete about this matter. I don't want my husband or anyone else to know about what happened.
dlga_lady_ask_for_quest:lady_pretalk.1|No, {playername}, non ho bisogno di un campione al momento.
; dlga_lady_mission_told:lady_mission_accepted|As you wish, {s65}, it shall be done.

; dlga_lady_mission_accepted:close_window|You are a true {reg59?lady:gentleman}, {playername}. Thank you so much for helping me
; dlga_lady_mission_rejected:close_window|You'll not help a woman in need? You should be ashamed, {playername}... Please leave me. I have some important embroidery to catch up on.
; dlga_lady_talk:lady_intrigue_lord|I think some lords have too much influence on our king. Can you help me to change that?
; dlga_lady_intrigue_lord:lady_intrigue_lord_2|Hmm, perhaps you're right. Who do you think exerts too much influence on our king?
dlga_lady_intrigue_lord_2:lady_intrigue_lord_3|{s1}
; dlga_lady_intrigue_lord_2:lady_pretalk|Never mind. I don't think it's worth it.
; dlga_lady_intrigue_lord_3:lady_intrigue_lord_3a|Well I can try to help you. I am sure a few carefully planted stories will make {s10} look rather bad in the eyes of the king.
; dlga_lady_intrigue_lord_3a:lady_intrigue_lord_4|You can try to influence {s10}'s relation with the king by spreading rumors about him or by framing him for a crime or an act of indiscretion, but it will obviously cost money. The more serious the charge, the more it will cost. A simple rumor could probably be arranged for {reg10} peningas. A more severe one could be spread for {reg11} peningas. If you want to frame someone, {reg12} peningas probably will be the price.
; dlga_lady_intrigue_lord_4:lady_intrigue_lord_5|I think a simple rumor will do for now.
; dlga_lady_intrigue_lord_4:lady_intrigue_lord_5.1|Maybe I can afford a more dangerous rumor.
; dlga_lady_intrigue_lord_4:lady_intrigue_lord_5.2|I think framing this lord is what I want to do.
; dlga_lady_intrigue_lord_4:lady_restore_relation_cant_afford|I don't think I am really up for this.
; dlga_lady_intrigue_lord_5:lady_intrigue_lord_6|Excellent. Then I'll make appropriate arrangements to discredit {s10}.
; dlga_lady_intrigue_lord_6:lady_pretalk|Thank you for your help, my love.

dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_restore_relation_2b|{s1}
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_pretalk|Non importa. Vado abbastanza d'accordo con tutti.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2b:lady_restore_relation_3|Bene proverò ad aiutarvi. Sono sicura che un piccolo regalo permetterà a {s10} di considerarvi in maniera più favorevole.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_3:lady_restore_relation_4|You can improve your relation with {s10} by sending {reg4?her:him} a gift worth {reg10} peningas. But if you can afford spending {reg11} peningas on the gift, it would make a good impression on {reg4?her:him}. And if you can go up to {reg12} peningas, that would really help smooth things out.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5|I think a gift of {reg10} peningas will do.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.1|Maybe I can afford {reg11} peningas.
; dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.2|In that case, I am ready to spend {reg12} peningas.

; dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.1|Enough, {playername}. You've made a lot of arguments, but I find none of them truly convincing. I stand by what I said before.

dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2|In accordo alle nostre leggi e tradizioni, potete fare svariate cose. Primo, potreste stanziare una guarnigione qui a proteggere il castello da ogni immediato contrattacco, poi richiedere un'udienza a qualche ricco lord e chiedergli di farvi un'offerta. Dovrebbe essere una somma considerevole, credetemi. Se non volete vendere, allora dovrete trovarvi un sovrano e protettore che voglia accettare un atto di vassallaggio da parte vostra. Senza un'investitura reale ed un esercito alle vostre spalle , avreste molte difficoltà a mantenere e difendere il castello. Sia voi che {s1} diverreste dei facili bersagli per qualsiasi persona che abbia dei soldati e qualche ambizione.

However, no lord in the land will recognize your claim to the castle unless it is verified by royal decree. They would call {s1} an outlaw stronghold and take it from you at the earliest opportunity.

; dlga_start:ransom_broker_intro|Greetings to you, {reg59?madam:sir}. You look like someone who should get to know me.
dlga_ransom_broker_intro:ransom_broker_intro_2|Perché?
dlga_ransom_broker_intro_2:ransom_broker_info_talk|Ho pagato il riscatto di molti poveri disgraziati catturati in queste guerre senza fine. Di solito lavoro tra la miniera di sale e il mercato degli schiavi sulla costa, vengo ingaggiato da chi ha 'perso' qualche parente o persona cara. Ma se durante una delle mie 'missioni di recupero' incrocio qualcuno che ha dei prigionieri... Beh, non c'è nulla di male se faccio qualche piccolo 'investimento'... E voi sembrate il tipo di persona che ha un prigioniero da vendere.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_families|E se le loro famiglie non possono pagare?
; dlga_ransom_broker_families:ransom_broker_info_talk|Oh, then I spin them a few heartwarming tales of life on the galleys. You'd be surprised what sorts of treasures a peasant can dig out of his cowshed or wheedle out of his cousins, assuming he's got the proper motivation! If, in the end, they cannot come up with the silver, then there are always slave merchants who are looking for galley slaves. One cannot do Heaven's work with an empty purse, you see.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_prices|Che cosa si può ottenere per un prigioniero?
; dlga_ransom_broker_prices:ransom_broker_info_talk|It varies. I fancy that I have a fine eye for assessing a ransom. There are a dozen little things about a man that will tell you whether he goes to bed hungry, or dines each night on soft dumplings and goose. The real money of course is in the gentry, and if you ever want to do my job you'll want to learn about every landowning family in the Northlands, their estates, their heraldry, their offspring both lawful and bastard, and, of course, their credit with the merchants.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_me|Potreste riscattarmi se ne avessi la possibilità?
; dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_me:ransom_broker_info_talk|Of course. I'm welcome in every court in the Northlands. There are not many who can say that! So always be sure to keep a pot of peningas buried somewhere, and a loyal servant who can find it in a hurry.

dlga_ransom_broker_pretalk:ransom_broker_talk|In ogni modo, se avete alcuni prigionieri, sarò felice di comprarli.

; dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk|Greetings, friend. You look like the kind of {reg59?person:man} who'd do well to know me. I travel a lot all across the Northlands and keep an open ear. I can provide you information that you might find useful. For a meager price of course.
; dlga_start:tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks|Greetings, {playername}. I saw your companion {s10} at in a mead hall in {s11} some days ago. I thought you might like to know.

dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk.1|Grazie, ma non m'interessa.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk.1|Salute, {playername}.
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretalk:tavern_traveler_talk|Si?
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms|Cosa potete dirmi di queste terre?
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2|The Northlands is divided into many kingdoms that can neither manage to live in peace with their neighbours nor eliminate them. As a result, there's seldom a break in the bitter wars that plague this land and drain its lifeblood. Well, at least this ought to be a good place to be for an adventurer such as you. With some luck and skill, you can make a name for yourself here, amass a fortune perhaps, or gain great power. Opportunities are endless, and so are the rewards, if you are willing to risk your life for them.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3|Parlatemi ancora di queste opportunità.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:close_window|Grazie. Era tutto quello che volevo sapere.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Bene, credo che sappiate già tutto quello che potrei dirvi. Sembra che ve la stiate cavando molto bene.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a|The kingdoms will pay good money for mercenaries if they are engaged in a war. If you have done a bit of fighting, speaking with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a mercenary contract.^^ Better rewards come if you can manage to become a vassal to a king. A vassal can own villages, castles and towns and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these estates. Normally, only nobles of the realm own land in this way, but in time of war, a king will not hesitate to accept someone who distinguishes {reg59?herself:himself} on the battlefield as a vassal, and grant {reg59?her:him} the right to own land.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|It is not unheard-of for adventurers to renounce allegiance to a king altogether, declare themselves kings, and claim land in their own name. This is a difficult path, however, as the great nobles of the land, with their long ancestries, are not likely to accept such upstarts as their monarch. Such rulers would need to be very careful in establishing their right to rule, or they would be set upon from all sides.
; dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5|It might be easier for an adventurer like you to pledge support to an existing king's rival.  There are many such pretenders in the Northlands -- those who are born to the right family, who go around and stir up trouble saying they have a better claim to the throne than the current king does. If those claim holders could find supporters, they could easily start civil wars and perhaps even replace the king one day.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6|Interessante. Dove posso trovare questi che hanno bisogno di supporto?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:close_window|Credo di aver sentito abbastanza. Grazie.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6:tavern_traveler_pretalk|La vita di un pretendente al trono potrebbe essere in pericolo nel suo stesso paese. Per questo, solitamente, risiedono presso le corti di altri regni in attesa di trovare qualcuno in grado di supportare la loro causa. Normalmente, ricevo delle notizie sulla loro posizione, quindi sono in grado di darvi delle informazioni abbastanza precise a questo proposito. Ma, ovviamente, vi chiederò un piccolo compenso per i miei servigi.

; dlga_start:minstrel_1|Greetings to you, {reg59?most noble lady:most noble sir}.
; dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_job_description|What is it that you do?
; dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_questions|I have some questions about courtship in these lands.
dlga_minstrel_1:minstrel_courtship_poem|Potete insegnarmi qualche poesia?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach|I can teach you the tale of Aeneas and Dido, from the Aeneid. It is an allegoric poem that describes how Dido, the Queen of Carthage, fell in love, under the influence of the gods, with the Trojan hero Aeneas. When reminded by Jupiter, he leaves his lover to fulfill his duty to found a new city, Dido commits suicide, cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome. Its theme -- of strong love separated by fate and cursed by suicide -- is appreciated by some noble ladies, but not all.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.1|I can teach you The Voyage of Bran. This Goidelic saga can be interpreted either erotically or prophetically. Bran, son o Fedbal, and his expedition of twenty-one companions journey to a distant island of luxury and pleasure. Upon return, he learns that ages have passed, and he and his expedition have already passed into myth. He can never again touch the soil of his homeland and sails off again. I believe that it appeals to women of a certain romantic temperament, but you risk scandalizing or boring others.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.2|I can teach you the tragic tale of Orpheus, son of Morpheus and the muse Calliope. It is a sad and powerful story. He travels to the Underworld to bring back Euridyce, his deceased wife, but is unable to obey the condition imposed by Hades and Persephone. Hear me.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.3|I can teach you the saga of Beowulf. It is a heroic tale, full of blood and battle. Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, battles three powerful antagonists: Grendel, a horrid monster, who has been attacking the resident warriors of the mead hall of Hrodgar, king of the Danish, Grendel's mother, and a terrible dragon. Hear me.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach.4|I can teach you the Aesopica, the famous fables of Aesop. The tales of this slave and storyteller usually feature animals, and are both comical, satirizing man and animal, and moral, for its practical lessons on life. Pay you heed.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_poem_teach:minstrel_courtship_poem_teach_2|To teach it to you, I will need some hours of your time -- and, of course, a small fee for my services. About 300 peningas would suffice.

dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_meet|Come può un corteggiatore incontrare una dama?
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo|Dopo avere incontrato una signora, come può il pretendente convincerla ad amarlo?
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_nobles|Tell me about marriage and love among the nobility of the Northlands
; dlga_minstrel_nobles:minstrel_nobles_2|Nobles are an odd lot. In the Northlands, a daughter is a political asset, to be given away to a lord with whom her father wishes to make an alliance. Yet the great families of this land idealize pure love between man and woman, and I have seen many a hardened warrior weep copious tears at the doomed ardour of Gwenhwyfar and Llwch Llenlleawg in the bards' songs -- even as he made plans to break his own daughter's heart.
; dlga_minstrel_nobles_2:minstrel_nobles_3|Fathers differ, of course. Some nobles will let their daughters choose a husband who pleases them. Others, however, feel that to allow their daughters any choice at all would be to diminish their own authority, and insist on imposing a groom whether she likes it or not.
; dlga_minstrel_nobles_3:minstrel_prequestions|But the majority will steer a middle course -- they will want to make the final decision about a groom, but will weigh their daughter's preferences heavily. Among other factors, a happy marriage is more likely to produce heirs, so there is still a place for courtship and for the use of skill and passion to win a lady's heart.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_daughter_father|Cosa succede se una lady e suo padre hanno opinioni discordanti su un pretendente?  
; dlga_minstrel_daughter_father:minstrel_daughter_father_2|It happens sometimes that a bride elopes. This is a major blow to the father's prestige, leading to lasting enmities. Indeed, a war may be fought over a woman. Now, that is a fine topic for a song.
dlga_minstrel_daughter_father_2:minstrel_prequestions|Alla fin fine, tuttavia, la maggior parte delle spose si sottomette alla scelta dei loro genitori. La famiglia di una nobildonna è tutto per lei, e poche hanno il coraggio di rischiare la disapprovazione dei parenti per il bene di un uomo che a malapena conoscono. La donna può struggersi per il suo amore, ma accetterà ugualmente lo sposo... E senza un amore tragico che cosa potremmo cantare?
; dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_player_role_2|Of course! Lords make a great deal of lineage, but in the end, lands and money speak louder than one's ancestors. Even though you are a foreigner, if you are coming up in the world, then many parents will consider you a fine catch.
; dlga_minstrel_player_role_2:minstrel_player_role_3|You will have to compete with many other lords of your realm, however, who will have an advantage. They have known these ladies from childhood and have been sized up as grooms by carefully discerning mothers and aunts. Some ladies may be fascinated by the stranger, yet opt for the familiar.
dlga_minstrel_player_role_3:minstrel_prequestions|Perciò sappiate questo... Potreste ritrovarvi con il cuore spezzato. Ma entrare nell'arena dell'amore temendo il crepacuore è come scendere sul campo di battaglia temendo le frecce del nemico. Mostrate coraggio, scrollatevi di dosso le remore del rifiuto e la vittoria potrebbe essere vostra!
; dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_female_player_3|Lady -- I will speak bluntly. Most of the lords of this land are looking for a demure maiden, whose skin as fair as snow -- and your skin is burnt brown by the sun. They want a maiden whose voice is soft as bells -- and your voice is hoarse from commanding men in battle. Also, although the lords of the Northlands appreciate poems about love, most also want heirs, and few women can ride and fight while with child.
dlga_minstrel_female_player_3:minstrel_prequestions|Tuttavia, non tutti i signori hanno una mentalità così convenzionale. Noi poeti cantiamo di sorelle della spada e cacciatrici, di donne che hanno forgiato il proprio destino senza tuttavia sacrificare la possibilità d'innamorarsi. Io non vi dico che per voi potrebbe essere facile trovare un marito devoto che accetti la vostra scelta di vita, ma non vi dico nemmeno che sia impossibile che ciò avvenga.
; dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_spouse_benefits|What advantage is there in seeking a {reg59?husband:wife}?
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2|Ah! Mostrate un animo romantico, vedo! Beh, a parte gli evidenti benefici dell'amore, la compagnia e altre cose, emh... Faccende domestiche, diciamo... Sposarsi nella nobiltà porta grandi vantaggi economici. Potete riuscire a forgiare una forte alleanza con la famiglia del coniuge, e una persona valida al vostro fianco può anche aiutare a manipolare la politica del regno a vostro vantaggio.
; dlga_minstrel_wife_benefits_2:minstrel_prequestions|What's more, most of the great families of the Northlands have at some point intermarried with royalty, which would boost your own claim to rule -- should you ever choose to assert it...
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2.1|Ah! Date sfoggio di gran romanticismo, vedo! Beh, a parte gli evidenti benefici amorosi, la compagnia e altre, emh, faccende domestiche... Sposarsi entro la nobiltà porta grandi vantaggi economici. Potrete aver accesso ai castelli e alle proprietà del congiunto, ed essere in grado di lavorare con chi vi sta a fianco per far avanzare entrambe le vostre posizioni nel regno.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet:minstrel_player_advice_meet_2|Every so often, a king or great lord of the Northlands will hold a feast. In towns, they will often be accompanied by tournaments. In castles, they will be accompanied by hunts. The feasts provide a chance for the lords to repair some of the rivalries that may undermine the strength of the realm. They also provide an opportunity for families to show off their eligible daughters, and ladies will often be allowed to mingle unsupervised with the guests.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet_2:minstrel_prequestions|Se vi capita l'occasione, potreste riuscire a parlare con una persona che v'interessa e... Attaccare bottone, per così dire... Questo vi qualificherà come potenziale pretendente, e di solito questa persona non mancherà di farvi capire se desidera che continuiate con il corteggiamento. Per inciso, se l'approcciate dopo aver mostrato il vostro valore nel torneo o nella caccia, allora potreste fare una prima impressione migliore di altre figure presenti in queste occasioni.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo:minstrel_player_advice_woo_2|Il corteggiamento di una persona richiede una certa quantità di tempo e pazienza, e diversi incontri distanziati nell'arco di vari mesi. Qualcuno realmente interessato a voi riuscirà sempre a trovare il modo di farvi sapere che desidera che andiate a porgere visita. In alternativa, potete semplicemente andare a chiedere al padre o al fratello il permesso d'incontrarvi. Se non avete il permesso del suo tutore, sarà possibile organizzare un appuntamento con altri mezzi.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo_3|Having arranged an assignment, you may then attempt to charm her and win her favor. Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of this is finding a topic of conversation. Most noblewomen lead a cloistered life, at least until they are married, and thus will have little to say that will interest you. On other hand, she will soon tire of hearing of your own deeds in the outside world.
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_3:minstrel_player_advice_woo_4|Uno strumento di sicuro successo nel corteggiamento è semplicemente quello di recitare una poesia famosa, e discuterne. In questo modo entrambi saranno sullo stesso piano, e nessuno dei due avrà il vantaggio di conoscenza e d'esperienza. Naturalmente, persone diverse hanno gusti poetici differenti.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_4:minstrel_player_advice_woo_5|At some point, you will be able to discuss directly the issue of marriage. She will then let you know if you measure up to what she wants in a husband. Some ladies will coolly assess who is the most prestigious of her suitors, while others will be guided by their passions. Some will look to your companions, to see whether you are the kind of husband who will treat her as an equal, while others will follow the lead of their fathers.
; dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_5:minstrel_prequestions|At any rate, it is a challenging business -- and do not forget, you may find that your suit prospers with a lady, only to have it falter on a father's political ambitions. So you must ask yourself: are you willing to risk disappointment and heartbreak? Alternately, are you willing to throw away your standing in society, to make enemies of allies, in pursuit of a forbidden love? Because if you are, then perhaps someday we will write poems about you.
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_job_description|Cos'altro fate voi poeti e musicisti?
dlga_minstrel_job_description:minstrel_courtship_prequestions|Io compongo e scrivo canzoni per i signori del regno e le loro dame. Qualche volta canto della guerra, a volte della virtù dei Re, e talvolta, per l'auditorio più sofisticato, mi concentro sulle virtù del vino. Per la maggior parte degli ascoltatori, tuttavia, io canto l'amore.

dlga_start:trainer_talk2|Buongiorno. Siamo pronti per l'addestramento di oggi?
; dlga_trainer_pretalk2:trainer_talk2|Well, are you ready for some training?
dlga_trainer_talk2:trainer_practice_11|Non vedo l'ora d'iniziare l'addestramento!
dlga_trainer_talk2:trainer_combat_begin1|Prima, ditemi qualcosa sul combattimento...
dlga_trainer_talk2:close_window|Ora devo andare via. Addio e grazie.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin1:trainer_talk_combat1|Cosa volete sapere?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat1|Cos'altro volete sapere?
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat1:trainer_explain_combat|Tell me about combat.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat1:trainer_pretalk2|I guess I know all theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
dlga_trainer_explain_combat:trainer_explain_combat_2|Bella domanda. La prima cosa che dovete conoscere come combattente è come difendervi. Tenersi lontano da possibili danni è la prima regola di combattimento, ed è molto più importante che causare danni agli altri. Tutti possono usare una spada per causare danni, ma solamente i combattenti esperti sanno anche difendersi dai colpi in arrivo.
dlga_trainer_explain_combat_2:trainer_explain_combat_3|Ora, difendersi è più facile se avete uno scudo. Bloccate gli attacchi con lo scudo. [Tieni premuto il tasto destro del mouse per alzare lo scudo e difenderti.] In questo modo, siete capace di deviare tutti gli attacchi frontali ma avrete i lati scoperti e anche dietro sarete vulnerabile.
dlga_trainer_explain_combat_3:trainer_explain_combat_4|Come faccio se non ho uno scudo?
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat_4:trainer_explain_combat_5|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore, you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way, you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat_5:trainer_explain_combat_6|Finally, Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_combat_6:trainer_explain_combat_7|Ecco una cosa utile.
dlga_trainer_explain_combat_7:trainer_explain_combat_8|È una buona tattica, ma ricordate che il vostro avversario vedrà il tipo d'attacco che state per sferrare e prenderà una posizione difensiva per contrastarvi. Se accade questo, dovete annullare il vostro attacco e rapidamente attaccare in un'altra direzione. [Puoi annullare il vostro attacco premendo rapidamente il tasto del mouse corretto.]
dlga_trainer_explain_combat_8:trainer_explain_combat_9|Se il mio avversario si sta difendendo contro la direzione in cui sto attaccando, annullerò il mio attacco ed userò un'altra direzione per il nuovo attacco.
; dlga_trainer_explain_combat_9:trainer_pretalk2|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [To control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_practice_11:trainer_practice_11|If I may say so, I see great warrior in you.^^Some sailors have been idle since we stopped. Let's see if one of them could help us.
; dlga_trainer_practice_11:novicemaster_are_you_ready1|A sailor will fight you. Are you ready?
dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready1:novicemaster_ready_to_fight1|Si, cominciamo.
dlga_novicemaster_ready_to_fight1:close_window|Potete iniziare. Buona fortuna.
; dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready1:novicemaster_not_ready1|Just a moment. I am not ready yet.
; dlga_novicemaster_not_ready1:close_window|Hey, you will never make it if you don't practice.
; dlga_start:close_window.90|Please, kind {reg59?madame:sir}, help us! I don't want to be a slave!
; dlga_start:bodo_prisoner_sl|Hi {playername}. Glad to see you are alive. I thought you were killed when Sven Bull Neck's men attacked us. I was not so lucky, as you can see.
; dlga_bodo_prisoner_sl:bodo_prisoner_s2|Bodo! What? Where is my mother? And who are these women?
; dlga_bodo_prisoner_sl:close_window|Let me get you out of here, my friend, and then we'll talk.
; dlga_bodo_prisoner_s2:close_window|We can't talk here; there are too many ears listening. Get me out of here, and I will tell you everything.
; dlga_start:close_window.91|Please, kind {reg59?madame:sir}, help us. I don't want to be a slave.
; dlga_start:bodo_merchant_1|Good day, {playername}. It is good to see that you are well. You were giving us a fright, talking in your sleep. I'd hate to be the one troubled by such dreams...
; dlga_bodo_merchant_1:bodo_merchant_2|I'm fine, thank you. No one has need to worry.
dlga_bodo_merchant_1:bodo_merchant_22|{s10}
; dlga_bodo_merchant_1:bodo_merchant_21|Well, I can't see how my affairs are anyone else's business!
; dlga_bodo_merchant_2:bodo_merchant_3|Perhaps not. At any rate, it's good to see you up and about, friend.
dlga_bodo_merchant_22:bodo_merchant_3|{s2}
; dlga_bodo_merchant_21:bodo_merchant_3|No need to get angry! I was just speaking as a friend. It's just good to see you up and about.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_3:bodo_merchant_4a|Remind me who you are. To tell the truth, my mind is still a little foggy.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_3:close_window|Thanks! Now I'm going to help check out those ships. Farewell for now.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_4a:bodo_merchant_5|Why, I am Bodo. I hail from Cantabria, in the Kingdom of Asturias, in the north of the land that the Romans called Hispania. We've become well acquainted on this voyage.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_5:bodo_merchant_6|Then I know you've told me your story, but I'd like to hear it again.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_5:close_window|Oh, that's right... Bodo. Well, I go now to help check out those ships. Farewell for now.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_6:bodo_merchant_7|Perhaps some other time. I think right now I want to keep an eye on the horizon. I'm not as convinced as the captain that stopping here is a good idea.
; dlga_start:close_window.92|I thought I saw something a minute ago, but the mist over these waters plays tricks on the eyes... Probably nothing. I hope it's nothing. This ship's fast enough, but can't outrun a warship.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_7:bodo_merchant_8|I'm worried as well. I'm glad you are watching, my friend.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_7:close_window|What could be the harm of it? But to speed things along, I will help check out those ships.
; dlga_bodo_merchant_8:close_window|And I'm glad to do it for you. We've become such good friends on this trip, I'm sorry we will soon part. If we meet again in the future and you need my help, you have it, my friend.
; dlga_start:esposabarco_1|{s2}^^My {reg59?daughter:son}, it is such a nice day! The sea is so bright! It is truly a pity to have all these shipwrecks spoil the scene!
; dlga_esposabarco_1:esposabarco_12|Yes, Mother. I'm glad you are well today.
; dlga_esposabarco_1:esposabarco_11|You remember me? That's wonderful!
; dlga_esposabarco_1:close_window|I will see you later, Mother.
; dlga_esposabarco_12:esposabarco_13|{s2}^^Not only well but happy! I'm glad we made this trip, but we must remember to be home to make dinner! Your father will expect it.
; dlga_esposabarco_11:esposabarco_13|{s2}^^You are my baby. I am your mother. Why would I or Father forget you?
; dlga_esposabarco_13:esposabarco_14|But... Father is dead.
; dlga_esposabarco_13:close_window|Mother, we are going home right now. I love you.
; dlga_esposabarco_14:esposabarco_15|{s2}^^But... But... We aren't on a trip near home, are we? My head hurts so much, I don't remember where home is! I know who you are, but I don't remember your name. Am I crazy?
; dlga_esposabarco_15:esposabarco_16|No, you've only forgotten a few things.
; dlga_esposabarco_15:esposabarco_17|No, you're just sick. But soon we will see someone that will make you better.
; dlga_esposabarco_15:close_window|Yes, but we're getting help for you. Farewell, then, for the moment.
; dlga_esposabarco_16:close_window|{s2}^^Oh dear. I think I need a moment alone. Please go.
; dlga_esposabarco_17:esposabarco_18|{s2}^^I am not so sure that anybody can heal this, my {reg59?daughter:son}.
; dlga_esposabarco_18:close_window|We are almost there! Please don't give up now. We'll talk more later.
; dlga_start:close_window.93|I'd like to chat, but I must complete my chores now.
; dlga_start:sailors_merchant_1|Ic grete thee, {playername}. I'd like to chat, but I must complete my chores now. We will talk later.
; dlga_sailors_merchant_1:close_window|Very well. We will talk tonight at the anchorage.
; dlga_start:close_window.94|[Enemy lookouts watch you closely from the walls of Readingum.]
; dlga_start:arquerosb_merchant_1|Talk to the boss, {playername}, that veteran in the prow of the boat over there. He's the one that can best train you in fighting.
; dlga_arquerosb_merchant_1:close_window|Thanks, I will do that.
; dlga_start:frisianship_merchant_1|West thu hal, {playername}. Are you well today? You were moving violently in your sleep and saying incomprehensible things. My sailors thought you were being tormented by a spirit.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_1:frisianship_merchant_2|Where am I? What is this place?
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_2:frisianship_merchant_3|Oh, this is bad. You don't remember anything? My name is Avo, leof. I am the captain of this ship, the Woden Ric. You embarked with us in Friese some weeks ago, paying well for us to take you on.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_3:frisianship_merchant_4a|Yes, yes, I remember now.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_3:frisianship_merchant_4b|Oh, it's coming back to me now, but perhaps you can remind me why am I here?
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_4a:frisianship_merchant_5|Well, don't worry. These things happen to everyone.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_4b:frisianship_merchant_5|Now I'm really starting to worry about you. I don't know the details, but do know that you worry for your mother. She is sick, and you were taking her to a priest of great healing ability in the Frisian port where we are going.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_5:frisianship_merchant_6|Thanks! But it's light out. Shouldn't we be under full sail? The boat is not moving! What is happening? Why have we stopped?
; dlga_start:close_window.95|May we talk later, {reg59?madame:sir}? I need to give some orders to my men.
; dlga_start:frisianship_merchant_talk|Good day. We are ready to cast off. Are you ready?
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_talk:frisianship_merchant_1x|I am ready. Please, let us continue our voyage.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_talk:close_window|No, I need to do something before we leave.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_1x:frisianship_merchant_2x|{s2}^^We've been together on this voyage some time. Would you like to try the rudder? She steers very nimbly for a merchantman.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_2x:close_window|Why, I've been wondering when you'd ask!
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_2x:close_window.1|No. Believe me, I think you'd want me to touch it only a last resort!
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_6:frisianship_merchant_7|We found a bit of wreckage, some half-sunken ships. Looks like there was a fight here recently. I have my men checking out the situation and looking for survivors. Poor bastards wouldn't have had a chance against Viking long ships. We'll be on our way soon enough, though.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_7:frisianship_merchant_8|Oh. Could we hurry it along? Whoever sunk those ships might still be nearby.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_7:close_window|Well, finally a bit of excitement! I think I'll go and help them.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_8:frisianship_merchant_9|{s2}^^Relax, {reg59?woman:man}. Your friend, Bodo, insisted on keeping watch. I doubt that fellow ever misses a thing!
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_9:frisianship_merchant_10|Bodo? Yes. Well, I'm still worried.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_9:frisianship_merchant_11|I sure hope you know what you're doing.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_10:close_window|{s2}^^If you had been on one of those ships instead of this one, you'd want us to stop, now wouldn't you? It's the law of the sea -- especially this sea.
; dlga_frisianship_merchant_11:close_window|Be assured, I do, {reg59?madame:sir}. Now let me tend to this matter, or we'll be delayed even longer.
; dlga_start:frisianship_mer_1|Oh, Woden, we're in trouble!
; dlga_start:close_window.96|May we talk later, {reg59?madame:sir}? I need to give some orders to my men.
; dlga_frisianship_mer_1:frisianship_mer_2|What's happened?
; dlga_frisianship_mer_2:frisianship_mer_3|Shh! Keep quiet. Listen, we're in danger. As we were watching your fight, two long ships arrived. Now I can see the banner. It's Sven Bull-Neck. Ah, dammit! You'd better pray to whatever gods you worship. Hell, you may as well pray to those you don't! Won't matter at all if he catches us.
; dlga_frisianship_mer_3:frisianship_mer_4c|I knew this would happen! We should not have stopped.
; dlga_frisianship_mer_3:frisianship_mer_4b|Calm down, man! Tell me: who's Sven?
; dlga_frisianship_mer_3:frisianship_mer_4c.1|This is terrible news! What shall we do?
; dlga_frisianship_mer_4b:frisianship_mer_4c|You've not heard of him? Sven's a Viking. Worse, a Viking's Viking. He burns villages and sinks ships and enslaves or kills everyone in them. Everyone! But it's worst for the one he chooses for a hideous death as a sacrifice to his gods. Heard of Blodorn, the Blood Eagle? You don't want to know what that means. Now keep quiet.
; dlga_frisianship_mer_4c:frisianship_mer_5|{s2}^^I think they're passing by. If we stay still right here, they may just think we're another bit of the wreckage. That's our only hope.
; dlga_frisianship_mer_5:frisianship_mer_6|What? We should have already been escaping into the mist. Row, men, for all it's worth!
; dlga_frisianship_mer_5:frisianship_mer_6.1|Please, calm down, my friend. We mustn't make a wrong move here!
; dlga_frisianship_mer_6:close_window|{s1}^^Sven's spotted us! They're turning this way! Nothing for it but to move. Cut the anchor and start rowing! Oh, Woden, it's no use. Help!
; dlga_start:petro_leader_1|Greetings! My name is Petro Didaz of Oveto, and I am a duke in the service of King Aldefonso of Asturias. These men are Silo, who comes from Farum in Gallaecia, and Gundinsalvo, who comes from Amaia, in Cantabria. We are surprised that you have submitted to us with so many ships and men. We want to know who you are.
; dlga_petro_leader_1:petro_leader_3|My name is {playername}. I come on behalf of the sons of Ragnar to negotiate with you.
; dlga_petro_leader_1:petro_leaderwessex_4|My name is {playername}. Aethelred, the king of West Seaxe, sends me to serve as your escort to his kingdom.
; dlga_petro_leader_3:petro_leader_31|I do not think that's...
; dlga_petro_leader_31:petro_leader_32|Ragnar's sons are powerful and well-known men. You should hear their proposal.
; dlga_petro_leader_32:petro_leader_33|{s2}^^Yes, listen to their messenger. After he sings his song, we can kill him.
; dlga_petro_leader_33:petro_leader_34|Rathbarth Ragnarsson wants you to join him and his brothers against West Seaxe.
; dlga_petro_leader_33:petro_leader_34.1|Rathbarth Ragnarsson promises you half of West Seaxe if you join him.
; dlga_petro_leader_33:petro_leader_34.2|Rathbarth Ragnarsson will fill your boat with riches if you join him.
; dlga_petro_leader_34:petro_leader_35|And if they do not join, what will he do? Kill them? Did he send you here with a fleet to make friends?
; dlga_petro_leader_35:petro_leader_36|Bodo?
; dlga_petro_leader_35:petro_leader_36_1|Exactly. It is your choice.
; dlga_petro_leader_35:petro_leader_36_2|If I wanted you dead, I would have attacked. I am offering an alliance with fellow winners.
; dlga_petro_leader_36_1:petro_leader_36|{s2}^^I like things simple and clear. I like this guy.
; dlga_petro_leader_36_2:petro_leader_36|Now you're talking.
; dlga_petro_leader_36:petro_leader_37|This {reg59?woman:man} is a liar. I traveled with {reg59?her:him} for a long time. I offered {reg59?her:him} my friendship. I fought beside {reg59?her:him} and served {reg59?her:him} faithfully. But when the time came, {reg59?she:he} betrayed me and delivered the letter to the Vikings. That's why {reg59?she:he} is here today with that fleet: to destroy you and the alliance between West Seaxe, Frankia and Asturias.
; dlga_petro_leader_37:petro_leader_37_1|The Danish rule the North. It will take an alliance to keep Asturias safe.
; dlga_petro_leader_37:petro_leader_38_1|West Seaxe is weak and ripe for conquest. Don't you want to enjoy the glory and loot?
; dlga_petro_leader_37:petro_leader_41|I didn't come this far to listen to this nonsense. What is your decision?
; dlga_petro_leader_37_1:petro_leader_37_2|That has been my position for some time now. Better Danmark than West Seaxe. The Danish control practically all the north while West Seaxe barely controls its own kingdom. An alliance with the Danish would mean that the Vikings would stay away from Asturias. Maybe we could even use them against Al-Andalus.
; dlga_petro_leader_37_2:petro_leader_37_3|What? Then all the fun would end. I like killing Vikings and keeping their boats.
; dlga_petro_leader_37_3:petro_leader_40|Someone who truly knows the north would not say that. The king of the Danish does not have the power to control the Vikings. The Vikings are free men who have embraced the sea to get wealth and fame, and if their king tried to stop them, they would find another king.
; dlga_petro_leader_38_1:petro_leader_38_2|West Seaxe can still fight, and I think it would be quite good at it. You sing well, messenger. It would be nice to switch our looting to places other than the lands of the Moors.
; dlga_petro_leader_38_2:petro_leader_38_3|Well, this sounds good to me.
; dlga_petro_leader_38_3:petro_leader_38_4|You're forgetting that our king has an alliance with the king of West Seaxe. Is it your intention to disobey your king?
; dlga_petro_leader_38_4:petro_leader_40|Do not be deceived by their flattering words. Anyone who pays attention to him ends badly.
; dlga_petro_leader_41:petro_leader_40|Are you listening to {reg59?her:him}? Makes demands like a king, and if they are not accepted, threatens with the sword.
; dlga_petro_leader_40:petro_leader_40_1|Bodo is a good man, but he will lead you to destruction if you listen to him.
; dlga_petro_leader_40:petro_leader_50|It's time for you to make a decision.
; dlga_petro_leader_40_1:petro_leader_50|There was a time that I loved and admired you. You tricked me, and I will never forgive you. The day will come when you will die by my hands.
; dlga_petro_leader_50:petro_leader_50_1|I have already expressed my opinion. My men will join the sons of Ragnar and make an alliance with the Danish in favor of Asturias. King Aldefonso will be satisfied.
; dlga_petro_leader_50_1:petro_leader_50_2|I did not bleed for a kingdom destined to perish. I'm with Silo. Join the Danish and ransack West Seaxe.
; dlga_petro_leader_50_1:petro_leader_50_2.1|I would prefer killing Danes rather than Saxons... Yes, that's my decision.
; dlga_petro_leader_50_2:petro_leader_51|King Aldefonso named me, his duke, lord of this army, to complete our mission of helping West Seaxe. Barring orders to the contrary, that is our goal, and anything else is treason.
; dlga_petro_leader_51:petro_leader_52|Your people cannot be trusted, Duke Petro. I am Bodo Vimaraniz from Malacoria. You know me, I am a man of the royal court and here is my seal. I did not want to resort to this...I am the word of the king here. I have given an order to have the West Seaxe fleet attack {playername}'s fleet. Look over there and enjoy the show!
; dlga_petro_leader_52:petro_leader_52_2|Silo is a traitor and will be executed. Gundinsalvo will gather and embark his Cantabrians now and prepare for battle. You, Petro, will leave some men here to protect our food supply and send the rest with Gundinsalvo. {playername} shall return to {reg59?her:his} ship to die with {reg59?her:his} men. We will advance from here with our ships in a pincer attack and end this matter. Then we will travel in aid of West Seaxe as agreed.
; dlga_petro_leader_52_2:petro_leader_52_3|You are not the king, and you have ordered an attack without our consent. This breaks all the rules. I'm going with {playername}, but I will not fight.
; dlga_petro_leader_52_3:petro_leader_53|Bodo, you're stupidly crazy! You're sending these men to their death.
; dlga_petro_leader_52_3:petro_leader_53.1|See you soon.
; dlga_petro_leader_53:close_window|Away with {playername}! Everyone must prepare for battle. Gundinsalvo, go with your men, but if you happen to betray him, you will pay dearly!
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_4:petro_leaderwessex_31|Welcome {playername}, we expected you days ago.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_31:petro_leaderwessex_32|The king of West Seaxe sent a nobody. That is an insult!
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_32:petro_leaderwessex_33|{s2}^^You get offended too easily, Silo.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_33:petro_leaderwessex_34|This man next to me, Bodo, is from Asturias.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_33:petro_leaderwessex_34_2|How many men and boats do you have?
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_34_2:petro_leaderwessex_34_1|{s2}^^Hah! I like someone who gets straight to the point.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_34:petro_leaderwessex_35|Thank you, {playername}, but Petro knows who I am. He has seen me in the royal court. I am one of the king's men, as my seal shows.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_34_1:petro_leaderwessex_34_8|They have more than 500 men and more than 20 boats, many of them obtained from the defeated Danish, {playername}. Petro knows me. He has seen me in the royal court. I am one of the king's men, as my seal shows.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_34_8:petro_leaderwessex_34_9|Yes, I'm glad to see you, Bodo. It has been many years.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_34_9:petro_leaderwessex_35|True, but now you know where I have been. This alliance between West Seaxe, Asturias and Frankia is my work.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_35:petro_leaderwessex_36_1|Glad to see this meeting of old friends.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_35:petro_leaderwessex_36_2|Well, before we leave, we have to talk about that man, Silo.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_36_1:petro_leaderwessex_36_2|Very diplomatic, but we have to tackle a thorny issue. Silo has been providing information to the Danish.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_36_2:petro_leaderwessex_37|What! What are you talking about?
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_37:petro_leaderwessex_37_1|Sigurd Ragnarsson mentioned his name when he spoke to {playername} about a traitor in Asturias who's been sending them information regularly. So Sigurd knew about the letter and my movements. He also knows about this fleet now.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_37_1:petro_leaderwessex_38_1|Everything he says is true.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_37_1:petro_leaderwessex_38_2|Silo should die now.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_37_1:petro_leaderwessex_38_1.1|(Say nothing)
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_38_1:petro_leaderwessex_39|What? You judge and condemn me merely based on the word of this stranger, mere riffraff? By God! I have a noble rank!
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_38_2:petro_leaderwessex_38_1|Kill him? This is a bit hasty, don't you think?
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_39:petro_leaderwessex_40|You should fear what I have to say more than anything else.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_40:petro_leaderwessex_41|Bodo's word means considerably more to me than any other proof or witness. However, we are not in the position to judge or condemn, for that is the king's prerogative. Silo, if you are a traitor, pray God to protect you, for the king won't have mercy. For now, you will be imprisoned and sent back to Asturias with the witness, {playername}, while we will continue on to West Seaxe.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_41:petro_leaderwessex_42|Very well, I will go to Asturias to testify against this man, Silo.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_41:petro_leaderwessex_42.1|Sorry, I can't go to Asturias. I have an unfinished business back in Englaland.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_42:petro_leaderwessex_43|I think no one is going anywhere. If I'm not mistaken, that smoke you see on the horizon comes from our guest's ships. It seems that the Danish have arrived. Maybe now you would understand my strategy.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_43:petro_leaderwessex_44|By the gods! Sorry, I mean my God! Both fleets are maneuvering for battle. The smoke comes from fire arrows.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_44:petro_leaderwessex_45|You must have the eyes of an eagle, Cantabro. We must help our allies before the Danes destroy them. Silo, we need your men on our side, they are the best sailors in our fleet.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_45:petro_leaderwessex_46|You should've thought of that before making grave accusations. My men will fight with me... Well, the Danish brought more boats, and I always ally with the winner.
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_46:petro_leaderwessex_48|You traitorous scum! I am taking the overall command. {playername}, return to your ships and try to contain the Danish. Gundinsalvo will be in charge of our fleet and will join you. I'll stay here in a safe place to coordinate a defense on the ground, so that you have a place to withdraw to if things go bad.^^ Go!
; dlga_petro_leaderwessex_48:close_window|You're insane! You should surrender. To me, my men! For Gallaecia!
; dlga_start:trainer_intro_1|Good day to you {reg59?lass:lad}. You look like another adventurer who has come to try {reg59?her:his} chance in these lands. Well, trust my word. You won't be able to survive long here unless you know how to fight yourself out of a tight spot.
; dlga_trainer_intro_1:trainer_intro_2|Thank you for your advice. This place looks like a training field. Can I learn about fighting here?
; dlga_trainer_intro_2:trainer_intro_3|Indeed, you can. I am a veteran soldier... fought a good deal in the wars in my time. But these days, I train young novices in this area. I can find you some opponents to practice with if you like. Or if you have any questions about theory of combat, feel free to ask.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4a|Si, ho alcune domande da farvi, in effetti.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4b|Posso iniziare ad addestrarmi.
dlga_trainer_intro_4a:trainer_talk_combat|Bene, chiedete pure quello che vi pare.
dlga_trainer_intro_4b:trainer_practice_1|Ottimo. È bello trovare qualcuno con l'ansia di fare pratica. Vediamo quello che sapete fare.
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1|È stato un buon combattimento.
; dlga_start:trainer_practice_1.1|Ha! Looks like you've developed a bit of a limp there. Don't worry. Even losses have their value, provided you learn from them. Shake the stars out of your eyes and get back in there. There's no other way to win.
dlga_start:trainer_talk|Buongiorno. Siamo pronti per l'addestramento di oggi?
dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Salve, iniziamo l'addestramento?
; dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk.1|Anything else, {playername}?
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_practice_1|Non vedo l'ora d'iniziare l'addestramento!
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|Prima, ditemi qualcosa sul combattimento...
; dlga_start:trainer_talk.1|Good day, {playername}. How may I help you?
; dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_training_lair0_tr|I'd like to discuss training options.
; dlga_trainer_training_lair0_tr:trainer_training_lair0|I can take your recruits and turn them into warriors.
; dlga_trainer_training_lair0:trainer_training_lair2|I need some men to be trained.
; dlga_trainer_training_lair0:trainer_training_lair4_stop|Please, stop training my men here.
dlga_trainer_training_lair0:trainer_pretalk|Niente.
; dlga_trainer_training_lair2:trainer_training_lair3a|Do you want me to use an alternative promotion when available?
dlga_trainer_training_lair3a:trainer_training_lair3|Si.
dlga_trainer_training_lair3a:trainer_training_lair3.1|No.
; dlga_trainer_training_lair3:trainer_talk|Alright, I will train the recruits in {s11}. Place the troops you want me to train at the bottom of the garrison list.
; dlga_trainer_training_lair4_stop:trainer_pretalk|As you wish, my {reg59?lady:lord}.
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|Ora devo andare via. Addio e grazie.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|Cosa volete sapere?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|Cos'altro volete sapere?
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Parlatemi delle tecniche di difesa.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Parlatemi delle tecniche d'attacco con arma alla mano.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Parlatemi delle tecniche di combattimento in sella ad un cavallo.
; dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Bella domanda. La prima cosa che dovete conoscere come combattente è come difendervi. Tenersi lontano da possibili danni è la prima regola di combattimento, ed è molto più importante che causare danni agli altri. Tutti possono usare una spada per causare danni, ma solamente i combattenti esperti sanno anche difendersi dai colpi in arrivo.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Ora, difendersi è più facile se avete uno scudo. Bloccate gli attacchi con lo scudo. [Tieni premuto il tasto destro del mouse per alzare lo scudo e difenderti.] In questo modo, siete capace di deviare tutti gli attacchi frontali ma avrete i lati scoperti e anche dietro sarete vulnerabile.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|Come faccio se non ho uno scudo?
; dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore, you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way, you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Bene. Attaccare è la miglior difesa, lo dicono in molti. I combattenti tattici trovano utile prendere una posizione offensiva e aspettare con la propria arma pronta per procedere all'attacco, attendendo il momento propizio per sferrare il colpo. [Prepara la tua arma per l'attacco tenendo premuto il pulsante sinistro del mouse.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|Ecco una cosa utile.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|È una buona tattica, ma ricordate che il vostro avversario vedrà il tipo d'attacco che state per sferrare e prenderà una posizione difensiva per contrastarvi. Se accade questo, dovete annullare il vostro attacco e rapidamente attaccare in un'altra direzione. [Puoi annullare il vostro attacco premendo rapidamente il tasto del mouse corretto.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|Se il mio avversario si sta difendendo contro la direzione in cui sto attaccando, annullerò il mio attacco ed userò un'altra direzione per il nuovo attacco.
; dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [To control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
; dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However, you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1|Qui addestro novizi in quattro livelli, ogni livello è più difficile del precedente. Finito un livello si passa al successivo, dovete vincere tre volte di seguito.
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready|You have passed all stages of training, but if you want, you can still practice. Are you ready?
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.1|Way to go {reg59?lass:lad}. With this victory, you have advanced to the next training level. From now on, your opponents will be regular fighters, not the riff-raff off the street, so be on your toes.
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.2|Way to go {reg59?lass:lad}. Welcome to the third training level. From now on, your opponents will be veteran fighters -- soldiers and arena regulars and the like. These guys know some dirty tricks, so keep your defense up.
; dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.3|You've got the heart of a champion, {reg59?lass:lad}, and the sword arm to match. From now on, your opponents will be champion fighters. These are the cream of the crop, the finest warriors I have trained. If you can best three of them in a row, you will join their ranks.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_finish_training|Sono lieto di notare che avete fatto grandi progressi e vedo che avete molto talento. Avete superato tutti i livelli d'addestramento. Ora potete dire a tutti con pieno diritto che avete ricevuto addestramento dal Maestro d'armi di questo campo.
dlga_novicemaster_finish_training:novicemaster_finish_training_2|Grazie Maestro.
; dlga_novicemaster_finish_training_2:close_window|I wish you good luck in the tournaments. And, don't forget, if you want to practice your sword work anytime, just come and say the word.

; dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready:novicemaster_not_ready|Just a moment. I am not ready yet.
; dlga_novicemaster_not_ready:close_window|Hey, you will never make it if you don't practice.
; dlga_start_craftsman_soon:close_window|Good day, my {reg59?lady:lord}. We hope to begin production in about {reg4} days
; dlga_start:master_craftsman_talk|Good day, my {reg59?lady:lord}. We are honored that you have chosen to visit us. What do you require?
; dlga_master_craftsman_pretalk:master_craftsman_talk|Very good, my {reg59?lady:lord}. Do you require anything else?
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_accounts|Controlliamo i libri contabili.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk|Controlliamo le scorte di magazzino.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.1|Voglio che voi vendiate le merci non appena vengono prodotte.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.2|Voglio che conserviate tutte le merci in magazzino fino al mio arrivo.
; dlga_master_craftsman_accounts:master_craftsman_pretalk|We currently produce {s3} worth {reg1} peningas each week, while the quantity of {s4} needed to manufacture it costs {reg2}, and labor and upkeep are {reg3}.{s9} This means that we theoretically make a {s12} of {reg0} peningas a week, assuming that we have no raw materials in the inventories, and that we sell directly to the market.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_production_options|Potete spiegarmi le mie possibilità di scelta relativamente alla produzione?
; dlga_master_craftsman_production_options:master_craftsman_production_options_2|Certainly, my {reg59?lady:lord}. Most of the time, the most profitable thing for you to do would be to let us buy raw materials and sell the finished goods directly to the market. Because of our longstanding relations with the local merchants, we can usually get a very good price.
dlga_master_craftsman_production_options_2:master_craftsman_pretalk|Tuttavia, se scoprite che si possono acquisire le materie prime ad un prezzo più economico fuori {s5}, potete depositarli nel magazzino, e noi useremo quelle invece di acquistarle al mercato. Allo stesso modo, se sentite che altrove si può ottenere un prezzo migliore per i prodotti finali, allora potete chiederci di depositare ciò che produciamo nei nostri magazzini per consentire a voi di portarli via.
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_auction_price|Non sarà più possibile per me continuare a operare in questa impresa.
; dlga_master_craftsman_auction_price:master_craftsman_auction_decide|A pity, my {reg59?lady:lord}. If we sell the land and the equipment, and liquidate the inventories, I estimate that we can get {reg4} peningas.
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_liquidation|Mi sembra ragionevole. Prego, procedi con la vendita.
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_pretalk|Hmm. Lasciamo perdere la questione.

; dlga_bardo_talk:bardo_sing|I want you to sing about me. I need to be known and famous.
; dlga_bardo_talk:bardo_sing_lady|I want you to write a poem for a lady.
; dlga_bardo_sing_lady:bardo_sing_lady2|It will cost you 500 peningas. What is the name of the lady?

; dlga_bardo_sing_lady3:bardo_pretalk|Very well, I will write a poem, and will recite it to {s34}, it will take me one week to do it.
; dlga_bardo_sing:bardo_sing2|My lord, I will write a poem so epic that the whole Northlands will know about the greatness of {playername} - he jumps with joy. -Finally, he stops and takes a deep breath-. In return, I am asking for a small sum to cover the cost of inks and... keep my creativity going. I will need 500 coins.
; dlga_bardo_sing2:bardo_pretalk|Take the money. It is nothing to a mighty hero like me.
; dlga_bardo_sing2:close_window|You ask for the same price as a happy widow, and undoubtedly I'd like her performance better.
; dlga_bardo_talk:bardo_cancion|Can you sing for me and my men?
; dlga_bardo_talk:close_window|A bard? Songs? Why don't you go out and earn your bread like the rest of us?
; dlga_bardo_cancion:bardo_cancion2|It will cost you 100 coins, I can sing...
; dlga_bardo_cancion2:close_window|Your best song.
; dlga_bardo_cancion2:bardo_pretalk|Never mind. I want to ask you something else.
; dlga_bardo_talk:bardo_bt|I would like to know about the 'Treasures of Britannia.'
; dlga_bardo_bt:bardo_bt2|Well, if you really want to know... then hear me! There are thirteen Treasures of Brittania:^One: Dyrnwyn, White Hilt, the sword of Rhydderch Hael. If a well-born man draw it, it bursts into flame from its hilt to its tip. Moreover, anyone who asks for it receives it. Because of this peculiarity, anyone Rhydderch would offer it to would reject it. Therefore, he was called Rhydderch the Generous.^^Two: The Hamper of Gwyddno Garanhir. Food for one man would be put in it, but when it was opened again, food for a hundred men would be found in it.
; dlga_bardo_bt2:bardo_bt3|Three: The Horn of Bran Galed from the north. Whatever drink might be wished for would be found in it.^Four: The Chariot of Morgan Mwynfawr. Wherever the driver might wish to be, there it would travel, and quickly.^Five: The Halter of Clydno Eiddyn. This was fixed by a staple to the foot of his bed. Whatever horse he might wish for, he would find in the halter.^Six: The Knife of Llawfrodedd Farchog. This would allow twenty and four men to eat at table.^Seven: The Cauldron of Dyrnwch the Giant. If meat for a brave man were put in it, it would instantly be cooked.
; dlga_bardo_bt3:bardo_bt4|Eight: The Whetstone of Tudwal Tudglyd. Any sword sharpened on this whetstone would not fail to kill any man from whom it drew blood.^Nine: The Coat of Padarn Beisrudd. If a well-born man put it on, it would be the right size for him.^Ten and Eleven: The Crock and the Dish of Rhygenydd the Cleric. Whatever food might be wished for, it would be found in them.^Twelve: The Chessboard of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio. If the pieces were set, they would play by themselves. The board was of gold, and the men of silver.^Thirteen: The Mantle of Arthur of Cornwall. Whoever is under it cannot be seen, yet he himself can see everyone.
; dlga_bardo_bt4:bardo_bt5|I would like to find these treasures.
; dlga_bardo_bt4:close_window|Interesting song. Thank you.
; dlga_bardo_bt5:bardo_bt6|Sorry, friend. That is a difficult quest. Most of the treasures were destroyed in Myrdyn's times, and the rest was lost. I doubt they'll ever be found.
; dlga_bardo_bt6:bardo_bt7|Sorry to hear that.
; dlga_bardo_bt6:bardo_bt8|I think you're lying to me. I want the treasure now, or you will die.
; dlga_bardo_bt6:close_window|I'm tired of this, Farewell.
; dlga_bardo_bt7:close_window|An ancestor of mine, Owain map Modred, told me about another man deceived by my ancestor's enemy, Conchobor, centuries ago. He tried to find the treasures in the days of kings Penda and Cadwallon, but was unsuccessful. The treasures are lost, and it's better this way.
; dlga_bardo_bt8:close_window|Do you think if I had these treasures, I would be here serving a king? No, I would be reviving the old knowledge of the Druids and trying to regain the Britannia that was lost with the death of my father. Farewell.

; dlga_sacerdote_angry:close_window|You... You... You are Satan, {playername} - his eyes burn like fire lit by the very flames of Hell - begone from my sight. This land shall neither feed you nor give you rest, for your place is among heathen lands soon to be burnt by God's wrath.
; dlga_sacerdote_talk:sacerdote_ayuda|I am a Christian, my father -you bow your head in respect-, and I must atone for my past sins.
; dlga_sacerdote_talk:sacerdote_ayuda.1|I am not a Christian, but I wish to be converted (conversion to Christianity).
; dlga_sacerdote_talk:close_window|I have no need for a man of God at this time.
; dlga_sacerdote_ayuda:sacerdote_ayuda2|Come, my child! - He smiles, pleased. - Our God is one of forgiveness and acceptance, not of revenge and hate like the Pagan devils the barbarians are so keen to worship. I am here to help you, {playername}, but you must also help the Church in return. I will pray for your soul, so that you may spend your eternal afterlife in Heaven, but you must donate 300 peningas. - He places his hand confidentially on your shoulder. - I can also preach in your name, {playername}, and let all the land know of your Christian purity and holiness, but you must fund my travels through the land. This will cost you 1000 peningas.
; dlga_sacerdote_ayuda2:sacerdote_sins|Praise God, that he may cleanse us of our sins. I will donate 300 coins.

; dlga_start:pagano_talk|West thu hal, {reg59?my lady:my lord}. I am a priest of Odin, the almighty carrier-off the dead, which, if brave enough, forever rest by his side at the great halls of Walhalla. He is also the trickster god, the one-eyed one, and the leader of the Wild Hunt.
; dlga_pagano_pretalk:pagano_talk|West thu hal, {playername}. What do you need?

; dlga_pagano_ayuda:pagano_ayuda2|Come, brave warrior! - He smiles, pleased. - Odin is more than pleased to smile upon great warriors like yourself, and he knows your feats of arms. I am here to bring you back to honour the old gods of our ancestors, {playername}, but you must also help us. Christianity spreads like a plague and displaces the old gods from their rightful seats. We need money to recruit warriors to kill their cowardly clerics. - He places his hands on your shoulders. - We ask for just 300 peningas. I can even tell everyone how {playername} is truly favoured by Odin, Thor, and Freiya, letting all the kingdom know of your respect for our gods, but you must fund my travels. My travel expenses would amount to 1000 peningas for that.

; dlga_pagano_sins:pagano_pretalk|Thank you, warrior of Woden. I will talk to your men about Woden and his sons Wecta, Baeldaeg, Casere and Wihtlaeg. That will encourage them to fight proudly by your side, to earn their seats at Waelcyrge.

; dlga_problema_juicio4:problema_juicio5|{s2}^^Some weeks ago, a monk found this document in our archives. It is a letter where a previous lord three generations back donated land next to the monastery to us. You can read it.

; dlga_abad_catach2c:abad_catach3c|Pater, it is too important for me. I need to find the hideout where a Viking holds prisoners. They are in danger. You must help me, pater. This book is my only hope to save them.

; dlga_abad_talk:addonsflaithbertach1|I know where Flaithbertach's grandchildren are.
; dlga_addonsflaithbertach1:addonsflaithbertach2|That's good news. You're lucky, for my patron wants to hear it directly from you. He is a powerful man who doesn't like long florid stories. When he asks you something, just give him a simple answer. I assure you that if you make a good impression, you will have a bright future. My patron's name is Mael Bresail. You can find him at the court of Aileach.
; dlga_addonsflaithbertach2:close_window|Very well, I will see you soon.
; dlga_abad_talk:addonsmaelflaithbertach1|I talked to Mael Bresail.
; dlga_addonsmaelflaithbertach1:addonsmaelflaithbertach2|Yes, I know. You surely noticed that he is generous toward those who serve him well.

; dlga_addonstoryabad2:addonstoryabad5|Give this money to the orphans. Who is your patron?
; dlga_addonstoryabad2:addonstoryabad4.1|Pater, give this money to the orphans and widows.
; dlga_addonstoryabad3:addonstoryabad4|You will learn that in time. For now, I will only say that he is someone important, a man who can make or break kings.
; dlga_addonstoryabad5:addonstoryabad4|I appreciate your interest in our orphans, but I cannot answer your question. My patron wants to remain anonymous for now. I will tell you that he is someone important, so important that he sits at the table with kings, and they listen.
; dlga_addonstoryabad4:addonstoryabad6|You will be surprised to know that my patron is a mighty man, and yet he has chosen you. He watches you, for his spies and informers are everywhere. He has entrusted you with an important mission, for which you will be generously rewarded.

; dlga_addonstoryabad6_1:addonstoryabad7descendiente1|--The abbot clears his throat and fixes his eyes on yours--^^A dangerous man, a robber and a murderer, the enemy of my patron, has taken refuge in the old land of the Picts and is recruiting an army of outlaws. He plans to return to Eriu and attack the good people that live here. My patron's spies have found out that this man is recruiting warriors from the mead hall of Scuin. This man must be stopped. You will be paid 5,000 peningas to put an end to his life.
; dlga_addonstoryabad7descendiente1:addonstoryabad8descendiente1|Tell me about this man and why he must die.

; dlga_addonstoryabad10descendiente1:addonstoryabad11descendiente1|Very well. I recommend that you travel with all haste to Scuin. Look for a man there called The 'Snake' in the mead hall. Return quickly once the problem is solved. Godspeed.

; dlga_addonstoryabad11descendiente1:close_window.1|I shall certainly do so, pater.
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead:addonsthesnakedead2|I know. Our spy sent a messenger with the news. Here is your reward. As you see, my patron is very generous.^^That being said, I have a suggestion. Our spy told us that you had bantered away with The 'Snake' too much. This was a mistake. He could have dissuaded you, and also the less you know about my patron's business, the better it is, for your own sake.
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead2:addonsthesnakedead2_1|Is that a threat?
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead2:addonsthesnakedead3|I understand.
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead2:addonsthesnakedead2_2|That's what I do.
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead2_1:addonsthesnakedead3|Hardly. I am an abbot, not a killer. It was a suggestion. Do what you want.^^But enough about that. I have another task for you that pays even better.
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead2_2:addonsthesnakedead3|It was just a suggestion. You are being paid well for this work, so it would be foolish to annoy your patron.^^But enough about that. I have another task for you that pays even better.
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead3:addonsthesnakedead4|There is another danger that threatens Eriu...
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead4:addonsthesnakedead4_1|I hope that it is not another murder. I am not an assassin.

; dlga_addonsthesnakedead4_1:addonsthesnakedead5|No, thank God. In this case, it is only information. Listen.
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead5:addonsthesnakedead6|Across the sea, Caer Meguaidd has become a refuge for the enemies of Eriu. It is a place that breeds intrigues. Two people in particular pose dangers to us - they are Flaithbertach's grandchildren. Your mission is simple: go and find out where they are hiding. As nobody connects you with my patron, you can simply ask the mayor, a man called Donngal, for this information. For this easy task, you will get another 5,000 peningas.
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead6:addonsthesnakedead7|We have a deal.
; dlga_addonsthesnakedead6:addonsthesnakedead8|No, I'm not interested. Sorry.

; dlga_addonsthesnakedead7:addonsthesnakedead9|Donngal has a weakness for gold. I'm sure you'll be able to convince him. Come back as soon as possible with news about the location of Flaithbertach's grandchildren. Good luck.

; dlga_addonsthesnakedead9:close_window.1|Farewell, pater.
; dlga_addonstoryabad6_1m:addonstoryabad7|--The abbot clears his throat and fixes his eyes on yours--^^At the west end of Eriu there is a village with, err... problems. It is a remote place, near harsh, sea-beaten cliffs and populated by fishermen. Its residents have asked for help because a great evil has befallen them. It shatters men beyond recognition and kidnaps their wives and children.
; dlga_addonstoryabad7:addonstoryabad8|My patron wants you to travel to this village, Bal Luighne, and talk to its leader. He will tell you all the details. Then put an end to the evil in the area and come back here. Nothing particularly complicated, but you will be paid handsomely for fulfilling your mission. To be precise, you will be paid 10,000 peningas for this favor.
; dlga_addonstoryabad8:addonstoryabad9_1|Are there not lords of Eriu that can deal with this problem?
; dlga_addonstoryabad8:addonstoryabad9_2|Can you tell me more about the evil that attacks them?
; dlga_addonstoryabad8:addonstoryabad9_3|Ten thousand peningas? Sounds good, but I want 2,000 extra for expenses now.
; dlga_addonstoryabad8:addonstoryabad9_4|If these people need help, I will go. Without a doubt, I am your hero.
; dlga_addonstoryabad8:addonstoryabad9_5|No, I'm not interested. Sorry.
; dlga_addonstoryabad9_1:addonstoryabad10_2|The lords in Eriu are too busy making war on each other, and the area near Bal Luighne is remote and unimportant. I hope my patron didn't make a mistake in selecting you...
; dlga_addonstoryabad9_2:addonstoryabad10_1|I have nothing else to add. The news lacks details, and the fishermen are terrified. I think the area leader of Bal Luighne would be the best person to get details from.
; dlga_addonstoryabad9_3:addonstoryabad11|As you know, money is not a problem, and I apologize for underestimating your needs. Take 2,000 more peningas. Now, we have a deal.
; dlga_addonstoryabad9_4:addonstoryabad11|That's what I expected to hear. My patron certainly was not wrong about you.
; dlga_addonstoryabad9_5:addonstoryabad10_2|I understand, but this is a unique opportunity for you. If you do not accept, another warlord will take the job. Are you sure you're not interested?
; dlga_addonstoryabad10_2:addonstoryabad9_2|Can you tell me more about the evil that attacks them?
; dlga_addonstoryabad10_2:addonstoryabad9_4|Forget what I said. I will go. Without a doubt, I am your hero.
; dlga_addonstoryabad10_2:addonstoryabad10_3|Yes, I am sure. I'm not interested. Farewell.
; dlga_addonstoryabad10_3:close_window|Well, I'm sorry about your answer, but I respect your decision. We will not be bothering you anymore.

; dlga_addonstoryabad10_1:addonstoryabad9_5|No, I'm not interested. Sorry.
; dlga_addonstoryabad11:addonstoryabad12|I recommend that you take your best weapons and travel with all haste to Bal Luighne. Look for a man there called Caliacas. Return quickly once the problem is solved. Godspeed.
; dlga_addonstoryabad12:close_window|You keep those 10,000 peningas handy, for I will return soon.
; dlga_addonstoryabad12:close_window.1|I shall certainly do so, pater.
; dlga_abadmorrigan_end1:abadmorrigan_end2|I did not expect anything less from you. Caliacas sent a messenger confirming that the attacks have ceased and the farmers have burned the devil's lair where Morrigan was hiding. Now, thanks to you, this world is safer. Here is your reward: 10,000 peningas.
; dlga_abadmorrigan_end2:abadmorrigan_end3|Thank you, abbot.
; dlga_abadmorrigan_end2:abadmorrigan_end3.1|Give that money to my men. They deserve all this silver.
; dlga_abadmorrigan_end3:abadmorrigan_end4|I have bad news. The men sent to kill Flaithbertach's grandchildren had succeeded, but when the Ard Ruire, Aed mac Niall, saw the bodies, he said that they were not the right children. Angry, he ordered the men executed. The king knows you were involved, so I would stay far away from his reach.
; dlga_abadmorrigan_end3:abadmorrigan_end4.1|I have bad news. When men sent to kill Flaithbertach's grandchildren came to the farm, they found nobody. I don't know what happened, but the Ard Ruire, Aed mac Niall, has promised to punish you if you cross his path. I would stay far away from his reach.
; dlga_abadmorrigan_end3:abad_pretalk|For my part, I have finished my task. Now you must go and see Mael Bresail. From now on, you will deal directly with him.

Good luck, {playername}.

; dlga_abadmaelbresail_2:close_window|I will be back later.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_3:abadmaelbresail_4|Did he try to kill you? Sorry, I knew nothing. I warned you that you need to serve him faithfully and unequivocally. Our patron is a man who rewards good work but punishes disloyalty or neglect severely.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_4:abadmaelbresail_5|I do not have time to chat. Where is he? Hurry!
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_4:abadmaelbresail_5_2|Your master organized a feast and tried to burn me inside the hall. (Persuasion)

; dlga_abadmaelbresail_4:close_window|I will be back later.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_5:abadmaelbresail_8|I cannot tell you what I do not know. You can torture me or kill me, but you will not get any further response from my lips.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_8:abadmaelbresail_8_1|This monastery needs silver to continue to prosper. Give me this information and I will donate 4,000 peningas, abbot.

; dlga_abadmaelbresail_8:abadmaelbresail_5_3|Do not waste my time. Reply now, or I'll kill you and burn your monastery. (Power Strike)
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_8:close_window|I will back later.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_8_1:abadmaelbresail_6|This monastery has been hard pressed by the attacks of the Vikings, so we need the money. I cannot refuse your donation and believe that this information will not cause harm to anyone. However, if somebody asks me, I will deny talking to you. Mael Bresail is very dangerous.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_5_2:abadmaelbresail_5_5|If Mael Bresail tried to kill me, it's likely he wants to eliminate all witnesses that may link him to the murder of Flaithbertach's grandchildren. Besides me, you are the only one who knows all the details. You are also at risk. If I find your boss soon, your life and mine will last longer. You know I am right.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_5_5:abadmaelbresail_6|But I am only a messenger, an intermediary between his desires and those who execute them! Oh, my God! He wants to kill me, too. Please help me!
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_5_3:abadmaelbresail_6|I know you're capable of such a deed, for I've followed your steps for a while now. Well, I'll tell you where he is, but I am only a messenger, an intermediary between Mael Bresail's desires and those who execute them. Please do not hurt anyone in this monastery.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_6:abadmaelbresail_6_11|There is a place where Mael Bresail feels safe, but ironically it is where he is the weakest, as only a few men travel with him there. Mael Bresail's mother is not Goidelic, but a Briton from Cornubia. She was kidnapped by a war party of the Ui Neill many years ago and was made a wife by one of its leaders, the father of Mael Bresail.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_6_11:abadmaelbresail_7|When his father died, Mael Bresail went back to her homeland and built a house for his mother and a fort for himself, near Bosvenegh. He goes there when he needs to visit or to rest. After what happened recently, he will go there to seek comfort and advice from his old mother. Few know this. I only know because once I had to accompany him to cure his mother. If you find him, remember that Mael Bresail is a reasonable man. Accept what he proposes. Revenge is useless.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_7:close_window|He tried to kill me. Only his death will stop me. Farewell.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_7:close_window.1|I always listen if the proposal is interesting. Farewell.
; dlga_abadmaelbresail_7:close_window.2|That's all I need. Farewell.
; dlga_abad_talk:abad_quest|Pater, is there anything I can do to help your monastery? 
; dlga_abad_quest:abad_quest1|Perhaps. We are building more houses for our new brothers, and we definitely need more timber. Would you be able to bring us {reg33} pallets?
; dlga_abad_quest:abad_pretalk|No, my son, we don't need your help at the moment
; dlga_abad_quest1:abad_pretalk|Pater, you can count on me
; dlga_abad_talk:abad_thankyou|Pater, I brought you {reg33} pallets of timber, as you requested.
; dlga_abad_thankyou:abad_pretalk|Thank you, {playername}. The brothers of {s3} will be praying nightly for your soul. Amen.
; dlga_abad_quest1:abad_pretalk.1|Pater, I don't believe I have time for this.
; dlga_abad_talk:abad_action|Pater, we need God to cleanse us of our sins. Here are 500 peningas for widows and orphans.
; dlga_abad_action:close_window|Ego absolvo te a peccatis tuis, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sanctii. Amen. Your men will feel better now.
; dlga_abad_talk:abad_talk_conv|Pater, I would like to know more about converting people to the one true faith!
; dlga_abad_talk_conv:abad_talk_conv1|Sure, my son. I will be more than happy to talk to you about the matters of Christianity, but I don't have a lot of free time. Would you consider a donation to our monastery? I think 500 peningas will help my brothers make this place even more beautiful.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv1:abad_talk_conv2|Of course, here is my donation.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv1:abad_pretalk|Sorry, I don't have this kind of money at the moment.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv1:close_window|I really don't see why I should pay you. Good day!
; dlga_abad_talk_conv2:abad_talk_conv2a|Thank you, my {reg59?daughter:son}. Our Lord, Jesus Christ will be pleased. Now, about conversion. You see, each settlement has some mix of true Christians, pagans, heretics and, God forbid, atheists. Every day, events affect people's beliefs. Some turn to Christianity, and others abandon it. That effect is fairly insignificant, on balance, unless there is some kind of force that compels people to choose one way over the others. Certain lords and minor adventurers come with a sword and try to force people to change their beliefs. That, of course, is not God's way.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv2a:abad_talk_conv2b|Our Lord, Jesus Christ, teaches us that any influence we exert on people should come through convincing, preaching and other non-violent means. However, force of threat produces results that are more spectacular, albeit short-lived. This can be improved by compelling people to build a house of worship and hiring a good priest to teach them. Initially, many people may not like that they are being forced to follow our God, but eventually, through God's Word, they change.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv2b:abad_talk_conv3|With persistence and patience, more and more people will turn to the only true faith, just as they have done elsewhere in Europe. The more people are converted, the easier it will be to convert the rest. But please be prepared for setbacks! Initially, it will be a difficult process. If too many people living in that particular place become too angry, they may even riot and burn down the house of worship. Even then, don't despair. Rebuild it and continue with your mission. Also, it helps if your settlement is near a monastery. God bless you, my {reg59?daughter:son}. I pray that your way will be blessed if you decide to follow this path. Amen.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv3:abad_pretalk|Thank you, father. That was very informative.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv3:abad_talk_conv4|You mentioned forced conversion...
; dlga_abad_talk_conv4:abad_talk_conv4a|Yes, my {reg59?daughter:son}. Some of our more overzealous brothers, especially the ones who consider themselves to be great soldiers, think that chopping off a few heads will force people to abandon their beliefs in favor of Christianity. While it may work to some degree in the very short term, inevitably these people will reconvert to their old gods the moment the sword is back in its sheath. If this is the path that you wish to take, I advise that you have a dozen or so clergymen with you to facilitate the process.
; dlga_abad_talk_conv4a:abad_pretalk|Being formidable is important, but it is also essential to be able to speak intelligently and persuasively. Your personality will also play a role. Being bold and courageous should help your case, as opposed to being shy and compassionate. Lastly, I highly recommend that you build up relations with the people first. It is well known that people are more receptive if they trust and like you. May God help you, my {reg59?daughter:son}. Amen.
; dlga_abad_talk:abad_talk_wine|Pater, I have heard great things about the wine of this monastery. Can I buy some of it?

; dlga_elf_treasure2:elf_treasure3|Alright! Let the fun begin! The game has started. There shall be... a question for a riddle and a riddle for a question. If you fail, I take your silver, but if you succeed, you get a reward! Maybe.
; dlga_elf_treasure3:elf_treasure4|My answer to your question: I'm from a nearby village. People hated me because I was thought to be the son of an elf, who bring bad luck. I had to flee, leaving my mother behind, and take refuge in here.^^Now it is my turn. Listen carefully to my riddle. If your answer is wrong, I'll take away some of your money, but if you answer correctly, I'll give you a reward. I want your money, I want your gold, I love silver and gold.

; dlga_elf_treasure6:elf_treasure8|That's not the correct answer. Your silver is mine. Let's have more fun!
; dlga_elf_treasure7:elf_treasure8|Yes, the hammer is used for working gold. I love gold! A hammer shouts out loud when it hits the hard anvil, and that is its road. Take your prize, and let's continue.
; dlga_elf_treasure8:elf_treasure9|What is that wonder^I saw in my ruins,^Eight feet it has^And four eyes^And knees above its belly.

; dlga_elf_treasure11:elf_treasure12|Yes, right answer! Maybe this was too easy. Take your prize and let's continue.

; dlga_druid_ayuda:druid_ayu|Our gods came largely from two families: the Children of Don and the Children of Llyr. Don was a goddess of the sky, and Llyr was a god of the sea. Don is known as the big mother. Among her children were the god Gwydion and the goddess Arianrod. Gwydion was a god druid, a 'master of illusion and fantasy.' He was a friend and helper of mankind, and a constant fighter against the powers of the underworld, the realm of Annwn.
; dlga_druid_ayu:druid_ayuda2|Arianrod, called the 'Silver Circle,' bore two sons, Dylan and Lleu. Dylan had a great affinity for the sea, and swam as well as the best fish in the ocean. It is said that the waves of Britannia wept for Dylan at his death. Arianrod had poor bonds with her other son Lleu, and his care was left largely to Gwydion. Math, the brother of the goddess Don, was a master of magic and Gwydion's teacher of spells. Do you want to make a sacrifice to the old gods? I warn you that they are fickle.

; dlga_druid_venta3:close_window|I'll tell you one thing: we are not here by chance. We are near the ancient Kingdom of Dyfed, a territory connected with Annwn, the Underworld. Here, we are close to all the gods and goddesses, because this is the time of their fall. The gods of Annwn are now the most powerful.

; dlga_mayor_begin:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed|{playername}, it was an incredible feat to get the {s14} and the {s15} to make peace, and you made it happen. Your involvement has not only saved our town from disaster, but it has also saved thousands of lives, and put an end to all the grief this bitter war has caused. As the townspeople of {s19}, know that we'll be good on our word, and we are ready to pay the {reg12} peningas we promised.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay|Grazie. Prenderò il denaro, dunque.

; dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2|Aye, my scouts saw the whole thing. That should make anyone else think twice before turning outlaw! The bounty is 40 peningas for every band, so that makes {reg1} in total. Here is your money, as promised.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:close_window|E questa non è l'unica buona notizia! Grazie a voi, i predoni non sono più una minaccia. Non subiamo un'attacco da molto tempo. Se qualcuno di loro è rimasto in vita, o sono fuggiti o si sono nascosti dandosi alla macchia. Ciò è buono per gli affari, e quello che è buono per affari è buono per la città!

; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_dongall_quest1|I've heard that the grandchildren of Flaithbertach are here. Did you know that?
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_dongall_quest6|About Flaithbertach's grandchildren...
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest1:mayor_dongall_quest2|Yes, everyone has heard of them. The children of the son of Flaithbertach mac Niall, the brother of Aed mac Niall, ri h-Erenn uile, called 'Findliath,' or 'Fair Warrior.' Flaithbertach's untimely death gave Aed access to the throne of Aileach. Flaithbertach's family had a bad end too, but two of his children escaped with the two grandchildren. I heard that one of the two who escaped died recently. I feel sorry for him. So very tragic.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest2:mayor_dongall_quest3|Could you tell me where to find them?
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest2:mayor_dongall_quest4|I have some silver that I want to give to this town (1000 peningas)

; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest3:mayor_dongall_quest5|Hiding somewhere where they cannot be found. They have many enemies.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest4:mayor_dongall_quest5|Your gift is welcome in these difficult times. I'll let the people of this town know of your interest in their welfare.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest5:mayor_dongall_quest6|I am very interested to know where Flaithbertach's grandchildren are.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest5:mayor_dongall_quest6.1|I must find them. This silver could help (1000 peningas)
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest5:mayor_dongall_quest6.2|I must find them. This silver could help (3000 peningas)
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest5:mayor_dongall_quest6.3|I must find them. This silver could help (5000 peningas)
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest6:mayor_pretalk|You look like a trustworthy sort, and I do not owe anything to Flaithbertach's grandchildren, but I would like in return service to my community. Make their life better so that they love you in this town, and then we'll talk again.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest6:mayor_dongall_quest7|You have done a lot for this town, and people appreciate you. I give you now what you seek: Flaithbertach's grandchildren are in a farm near Dinas Bran. I don't know why you are so interested in them. They are only two children eight years old. They are alone in life after the death of their father. I understand that Aed Findliath wants to get rid of any pretender to his throne, but these children have no one to support them. They are hardly a danger to him.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest7:close_window|Children grow, Donngal. Anyway, this is none of our concern. Farewell.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest7:mayor_dongall_quest8|I will save these poor children.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest8:mayor_dongall_quest9|Glad to hear that! I interpreted by your words that the murderers of Flaithbertach sent you find his grandchildren. If you go back to them and tell them that you have not found anything, they will continue looking for them. If you really want to keep these children safe, you need to lie. You must go back to Aed Findliath and tell him where the children are. Meanwhile, I could have Flaithbertach's grandchildren moved to another farm and put two young slaves in their place.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest9:mayor_dongall_quest10_1|That will work. Do it.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest9:mayor_dongall_quest10|No, other children aren't the solution.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest10:mayor_dongall_quest11|They're just slaves, but it's your decision. I can find safety for Flaithbertach's grandchildren. I guess you can go back to your lord and tell him where the farm is. They will find the farm empty, but you will have a few weeks before they do. Then you must leave Eriu, where Ard Ruire Aed mac Niall will become your worst enemy.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest10_1:close_window|Very well, I'll take care of everything. Thankfully, the wergild for little slaves is not much. Good luck.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest11:mayor_dongall_quest10_1|Forget what I said. We will follow your idea about using little slaves.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest11:mayor_dongall_quest12|I can carry the hatred of a king better than the weight of the death of two children.
; dlga_mayor_dongall_quest12:close_window|Very well, I'll take care of everything. Good luck; Ard Ruire Aed is a terrible enemy.
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_historia|My good man, can you tell me about this place?
; dlga_mayor_historia:mayor_historia2|I certainly can. You definitely posed your question to the right man. I grew up here in Lundenwic and have seen the town grow bigger every year. It must be the busiest town in all of Mierce. One can't see the harbour from here, but it's bustling with activity, ships coming in all day long. One can make a nice profit setting up an enterprise here.
; dlga_mayor_historia2:mayor_talk|If one walks further east, down the river, one can see the ruins of the Roman town that once was there, but I wouldn't bother. There's hardly anything left there but rubble and silence now. When the Romans left, they took all the trade and engineering skills with them, so the place slowly crumbled into dust. Fortunately, that's all in the past now.
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_histori|Greetings. Could you perhaps tell me about this place?
; dlga_mayor_histori:mayor_histori2|I surely can. Did getting up here bring sweat to your forehead? I bet it did! You're probably too proud to admit it, but everyone must catch their breath once they reach the town walls. It's not just from being amazed by the majestic size of this place but also from ascending the steep path leading up here. You've come to the royal town of Bernaccia: Bebbanburh. This is where our kings resided centuries ago.
; dlga_mayor_histori2:mayor_histori3|No doubt you understand why it was made the royal seat. With the sea on one side, cliffs on the other and just a narrow path leading up here, it's a well-protected town. Since it was guarded by wise and holy men, it was impossible to conquer. Although I should just say 'wise.' King Aethelfrith, who named the town after his wife Bebba, was certainly not holy. He was the first Northumbrian king and such a ruthless and steely leader of his men, that the natives here, the Britons, called him 'The Destroyer.'
; dlga_mayor_histori3:mayor_talk|He has kept this kingdom together in troublesome times, and he and his son Oswald conquered vast areas of land to the west. Two centuries ago, our kingdom became the most powerful of Britain. King Oswiu gained supremacy over Mercia, becoming Brytenwalda. Those golden days are unfortunately gone. Not too far away from here, there is the holy island of Lindisfarne, where the Danes attacked us for the first time. Ever since that day, we have suffered from their raids. Now our kingdom is under the thumbs of those accursed Norsemen, and our ruler Ecgberht is nothing more than just a puppet in Jorvik. But here in Bebbanburh his influence is minimal, and good people of this town still resist.
; dlga_mayor_talk:town_tax|I would like to set a new tax rate for this town.
; dlga_town_tax:town_tax2|Certainly. What taxes do you want us to pay to you?
; dlga_town_tax2:town_tax3|I would like to set a low tax rate.
; dlga_town_tax2:town_tax3.1|I would like to set a high tax rate.
; dlga_town_tax2:town_tax3.2|I would like to set a normal tax rate.
; dlga_town_tax2:mayor_pretalk|Actually, I changed my mind.
; dlga_town_tax3:mayor_pretalk|Most certainly! We shall abide by your most gracious order.

; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_wealth_comparison_1|How does the wealth of this region compare with the rest of the North?
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_investment_possible|I wish to buy a farmstead near this town and hire a foreman.
; dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_talk_cattle|I have {reg25} cattle with me. Would you be interested in buying any?
; dlga_mayor_talk_cattle:mayor_talk_cattle1|Hmm, I wonder how many are 'borrowed'...
; dlga_mayor_talk_cattle:mayor_talk_cattle1.1|Hmm, I wonder if we really need more cattle...
; dlga_mayor_talk_cattle1:mayor_talk_cattle2|I don't think cattle care who their owner is...
; dlga_mayor_talk_cattle1:mayor_talk_cattle2.1|One can't eat silver, should one need to eat...
; dlga_mayor_talk_cattle2:mayor_talk_cattle3|Alright, I'll pay you {reg26} peningas per head. Do we have a deal?
; dlga_mayor_talk_cattle3:mayor_pretalk|No, that's too little.
; dlga_mayor_talk_cattle3:mayor_pretalk.1|Agreed. The cattle are nearby and just lack someone to fetch them.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk|You already operate a {s4} here, and no one around here is selling his farm.
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.1|{s9}
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.1|Of course, {reg59?my lady:sir}. You are the lord of this town, and no one is going to stop you.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment|Well... Given your relationship with our lord, {s4}, I think that you will not find many here who are brave enough to sell you a farm.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.2|Well, to be honest, I think that we in the town would like to know you a little better. We can be very particular about outsiders coming here and buying a farm.
; dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.2|Very good, {reg59?my lady:sir}. We in the town know and trust you, and I think I could find someone to sell you the land you need.
; dlga_mayor_investment_advice:investment_choose_enterprise|There are a couple of things to keep in mind. Skilled foremen are always at a premium, so I doubt that you will be able to buy more land here. In order to make a profit for yourself, you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply, but for which the raw materials are cheap. A farmstead can engage in many economic activities, especially in enhancing production of local products.
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary|It must have a mill and bakery, to make bread from wheat
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.1|It must have a brewery, to make ale from wheat
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.2|It must have a foundry, to make tools from iron
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.3|It must have a weavery, to make wool cloth from wool
; dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.4|It must have a weavery, to make linen from flax
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:mayor_pretalk|Non importa
; dlga_investment_summary:mayor_investment_confirm|Very good, {reg59?my lady:sir}. The farmstead and the materials out of which you can build your {s3} will cost you {reg7} peningas. Right now, your {s3} will produce {s4} worth {reg1} peningas each week, while the {s6} needed to manufacture that much will be {reg2}, and labor and upkeep will be {reg3}.{s9} I would guess that your profit will be {reg0} peningas a week. This assumes of course that prices remain constant, but, I can virtually guarantee you, they will not. Do you wish to proceed?
; dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_investment_purchase|Yes. Here is money for the farmstead.
dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_pretalk|No, questo al momento attuale non è conveniente per me.
; dlga_mayor_investment_purchase:mayor_pretalk|Very good. Your farmstead should be up and running in about two weeks. Whenever you visit after that, you can speak to your {s4} about its operations.

dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_info_lord|Chi governa questa città?
; dlga_mayor_info_lord:mayor_info_talk|Our town's lord and protector is {s10}. {s10} owns the castle and sometimes resides here and collects taxes from the town. However, we regulate ourselves in most of the matters that concern ourselves. As the town's mayor, I have the authority to decide those things.{s33}
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_pretalk|Era tutto ciò che volevo sapere. Grazie.
; dlga_mayor_political_talk:mayor_political_questions|Politics? Good heaven, the guild has nothing to do with politics. We are loyal servants of {s10}. We merely govern our own affairs, pass on the townspeople's concerns to our lords and masters, and maybe warn them from time to time against evil advice. Anyway, what did you wish to ask?
dlga_mayor_prepolitics:mayor_political_questions|Ho già detto che qui siamo tutti {s9}? perché non posso sottolinearlo mai a sufficienza... Comunque... C'e altro?
; dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_war_description_1|What is the cause of all these wars in the Northlands?
; dlga_mayor_war_description_1:mayor_war_description_2|Well, to answer your question generally, each monarch claims to be the rightful heir to the title of Brytenwalda, ruler of Englaland. Some of these claims are based on forgotten dynastic marriages and others are based on obscure promises, while some others are forged through sheer strength of arms. So in theory, any one realm has the right to declare war on any other realm at any time.
; dlga_mayor_war_description_2:mayor_war_description_3|In practice, to make war is exhausting work. It is easy enough to lay waste to the enemy's farmland, but crops will grow back, and it is a far different matter to capture an enemy stronghold and to hold it. So the monarchs of the Northlands will fight a little, sign a truce, fight a little more, and so on and so forth. Often, a monarch will go to war when another realm provokes them. At such times, some bad influences who look to enrich themselves with ransoms and pillage will clamor for retribution, and thus the damage caused by war to a monarch's treasury is less than the damage caused by doing nothing would be to his authority... I'm of course not talking about {s10}, as no one would ever question {reg4?her:his} authority
; dlga_mayor_war_description_3:mayor_war_description_4|I would stress again that us merchants have nothing to do with politics. But if {s10} were to ask for my advice on these matters, as a loyal subject, I would tell {reg4?her:him} that while {reg4?her:his} claim to all of the Northlands is truly just, even the most legitimate claim must be backed by armed men, and armed men want money, and money comes from trade, and war ruins trade, so sometimes the best way to push a claim is not to push it, if you know what I mean...

Dite soltanto 'il popolo di {s4}' mi ha detto questo. La nostra opinione personale, ovviamente, coincide con i migliori interessi di {s10}.

dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_internal_politics|Cosa mi potete dire sulla politica interna dei regni?
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics:mayor_internal_politics_2|Well, here in the {s4}, we are all united by our love for {s5} and support for {reg59?her:his} legitimate claim to the rulership of all these lands, but I have heard some talk of internal bickering in other realms...
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_2:mayor_internal_politics_3|I signori di un regno spesso hanno idee molto diverse circa l'onore, la strategia, e il modo in cui un nobile dovrebbe comportarsi... Inoltre, essi sono in concorrenza tra di loro per conquistare il favore del Re, e controllano costantemente la loro posizione gerarchica, quella dei loro amici e della famiglia, nonché la condizione dei loro nemici.
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_3:mayor_internal_politics_4|Alla base di tutte le tensioni c'è la possibilità che un signore possa abbandonare il proprio sovrano, e rendere omaggio ad un altro. In teoria, ogni lord ha prestato un giuramento di vassallaggio, ma in pratica, un vassallo può sempre trovare una scusa per assolvere se stesso da quest'obbligo. Il vassallo può affermare che il sovrano non è riuscito a tener fede ai suoi obblighi, come proteggere il vassallo e trattarlo con giustizia. In alternativa, il vassallo può affermare che il suo sovrano è in realtà un usurpatore, che un altro ha maggior diritto di regnare in luogo suo.
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_4:mayor_internal_politics_5|Sovrani e vassalli si controllano costantemente a vicenda e con grande attenzione. Se un Re ritiene che un suo vassallo stia per cambiare bandiera o stia per ribellarsi, allora può accusare il vassallo di tradimento ed espropriare i suoi possedimenti. Allo stesso modo, se un vassallo teme d'essere incriminato, può ribellarsi. Di solito, chi fa la prima mossa è in grado di controllare la fortezza del vassallo.
; dlga_mayor_internal_politics_5:mayor_prepolitics|Now, men do not trust a vassal who turns coat easily, nor do they trust a king who lightly throws around charges of treason. Those two factors can keep a realm together, but if relations between a vassal and a liege deteriorate far enough, things can become very tense indeed... In other lands, of course. These things could never happen here in the {s4}.

dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_explain_2|Beh, c'è un favore molto grande che potreste farci...

dlga_merchant_quest_explain_2:merchant_quest_brief|Non stiamo dicendo che {s5} dovrebbe trascurare quest'aggressione, anzi!

They've been ambushing and robbing townspeople under the cover of night. Then they fade away, quick as lightning, when the guards finally show up. We've not been able to catch a one of them. They only attack lone people, never daring to show themselves when there's a group about. I need someone who can take on these bandits alone and win.

; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik2a:village_elder_thonkrik3|That isn't necessary. No debt, my friend! Rescuing others from distress at sea is the duty of every fisherman!^We found you unconscious, clinging to a plank and led by the tide. Fortunately, you were not far from the coast.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik2b:village_elder_thonkrik3|Well, {playername}, go ahead.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik3:village_elder_thonkrik4|We were traveling on a ship, the Woden Ric, and were attacked by Vikings! That's the reason you found me in the sea.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik4:village_elder_thonkrik5|I know the Woden Ric! It made landfall at Doccinga many times, because it had passengers seeking cures for the most terrible ills.^The father of the healer who has healed you was a man well known for his skills in many parts, and thousands of people left everything to come here. Now that man has died, and unfortunately his son does not have his father's magic.^I am sorry to hear that the Woden Ric was attacked by Vikings...
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik5:village_elder_thonkrik7|I was one of those people. My mother was sick, and now, maybe she... is dead.
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik5:village_elder_thonkrik7.1|My mother traveled with me. Did you find other people or... corpses where you found me?
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik7:village_elder_thonkrik8|The sea brings swollen corpses and wrecks to our shores sometimes, but nobody lately. Usually, Vikings take prisoners to sell as slaves...

; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik9:village_elder_thonkrik10|{s1}^^Sven Bull Neck? Oh, my good God! It is a miracle then that you are alive. Sven is a murderer, and his men are demons. He takes no prisoners, kills the whole crew, and burns the ship with the corpses inside.^He does not look for riches. Sven is more ambitious.

; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik11:village_elder_thonkrik12|{s3}^^To seek Sven? Are you crazy? You are not listening to me! Look around? See those men training here? They are hardened warriors, sent by our jarl! They are here to defend us from Sven's attacks. And we are lucky! Other villages don't enjoy as much importance to the jarl.^No, no, I know nothing about Sven!
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik12:village_elder_thonkrik13|And so what? They are not looking for Sven. Where is Sven? I want an answer now!
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik12:village_elder_thonkrik15|Thonkrik, I need your help. Don't you know I can help you kill Sven?
; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik13:village_elder_thonkrik14|I don't have an answer for you. I am but a simple villager who yet, I may point out, retains his head. If you are so intent on your own destruction, you should ask the jarl of Kennemer. God has given you a second chance, saving your life, but now you intend to waste it.

; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik15:village_elder_thonkrik16|{s1}^^{playername}, look at yourself! You are weak, puny! Almost dead just weeks ago saved by lowly fishermen.

; dlga_village_elder_thonkrik17:village_elder_pretalk|I see the determination in your eyes. Here, take these few coins and my advice along with them: find a job and forget about Sven. Otherwise, feel free to ask the jarl of Kennemer, he might be able to help you.

; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca4:doccinga_thonkrikca3|{s2}^^Those boats are Sven's, that's for sure. He always leads them. But this many men... I've never heard of Sven Bull Neck attacking a village with so many. It looks like an invasion!
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca5:doccinga_thonkrikca51|{s4} will not come, I know. Some of the people here sent messengers, too, like you and the king, but he did not respond.^^Normally, I would not talk about this openly, for they are Danish problems, but {s4} has left my people to their fate. In fact, I fear that all this is because of him.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca51:doccinga_thonkrikca6|{s2}^^I know people who work in the jarl's house, and it is rumored that he aspires to the throne of Friese... I should not say this, but Sven Bull Neck has been there in the past.^I fear that these boats are attacking Doccinga to bring Sven's warriors to help the jarl capture the throne, but these are just my assumptions.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca6:doccinga_thonkrikca71|Damn traitor. He's been playing with me.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca6:doccinga_thonkrikca72|I'll take care of that issue later. Right now, I have to stop an invasion.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca71:doccinga_thonkrikca72|Be careful with him, he is a dangerous man.
; dlga_doccinga_thonkrikca72:doccinga_thonkrikca72_f|Ic bancie the! Thank you for coming to help, {playername}. I will join my people now. A huskarl from the king leads the defense.

; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_mu:doccinga_interrogation_11|It will be done as you have said. As for you, what will you do now?
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_11:doccinga_interrogation_2|In Friese, I'm not wanted. I've earned powerful enemies against whom I cannot fight now, Thonkrik. My priority is my mother. I must save her.

; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_2:doccinga_interrogation_3|I know you'll be back someday...
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_3:doccinga_interrogation_31|Yes, with an army. The jarls and the king of Friese will pay for what they have done to me.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_3:doccinga_interrogation_32|No, I hate this land. You will not see me again.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_3:doccinga_interrogation_33|It is possible. If I return, I will stop in Doccinga to say hello, friend.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_31:doccinga_interrogation_4|I understand it. You're a {reg59?woman:man} haunted by revenge: Sven, Sigurd, and now the jarl of Kennemer. I hope you find peace someday.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_32:doccinga_interrogation_4|Then, may fate accept that someday you will make your way back.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_33:doccinga_interrogation_4|So I hope! The people of Doccinga love and admire you. Here you will always find a bed to sleep on and fire to warm up by.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_4:doccinga_interrogation_5|Now, I need to find a boat that is traveling to Ribe...
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_5:doccinga_interrogation_51|I can help you with that. One of the Sven's boats was left behind relatively undamaged and has been repaired in secret. It is our gift to you for saving us. The ship awaits you at a beach near Doccinga... and also someone else is waiting for you there. I have a favor to ask, {playername}.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_51:doccinga_interrogation_52|You remember I told you that someone was in the house of the jarl of Kennemer? Someone passing me information? Well that person is my daughter. The jarl snatched her to serve in his house as a maid for his wife. She managed to escape from Kennemer, and now I want you to take her along. If the jarl finds her, he'd take her back to his house, or maybe he would kill her. I need you to do this for me, {playername}, and the boat is yours.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_52:doccinga_interrogation_6|I'll take her with me and will protect her.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_52:doccinga_interrogation_54|No. Where I'm going is no place for a girl. I cannot protect her. She should stay here.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_54:doccinga_interrogation_6|Do not make me beg, my friend. Do you think you have several ships to choose from? There is no other mode of transportation for you. With Sven's attacks, merchants take weeks to come back here. You don't know what they did to my daughter in Kennemer, {playername}... I do not want her warming again the bed of any of the jarl's men. Sorry, but there is no choice: the ship and my daughter go together.
; dlga_doccinga_interrogation_6:doccinga_interrogation_61|Well, I'll take her and the ship. Farewell, Thonkrik.

; dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_caliacas1|Caliacas? The abbot of Finian sent me.

; dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_caliacassuccess1|Your village is safe. You will not have more problems with Morrigan.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas1:village_elder_caliacas2|Ah, the abbot is a good man to respond to our call so promptly! I asked him for three heroes, and in fact, three heroes have come! You are the last to arrive, so you are the most anticipated, since the evil that has befallen our land is terrible indeed. Many have died, others have fled, and the few that remain can hardly keep their sanity.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas2:village_elder_caliacas3|Stop! Three heroes? What do you mean?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas2:village_elder_caliacas3.1|Three heroes? You do not need so many. You have me. Dismiss them.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas3:village_elder_caliacas4|The evil that afflicts us is magical, so we must fight it with magic. Three is the number of the old gods, so the old man said three should be the number of heroes. Any other number will fail and die. At first, we did not believe him, you understand. We are Christians, and our priest said the old man was a pagan and should be burned, and that's what we did. But we were idiots. The old gods are still here, and they want revenge. Now the old man is dead and cannot aid us more, and our priest has disappeared.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas4:village_elder_caliacas5_1|You burned the poor old man? You deserve what you're going through!
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas4:village_elder_caliacas5_2|No doubt, that old man had something to do with this. Better to solve this without him.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas4:village_elder_caliacas5_3|What else did this old man say?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas5_1:village_elder_caliacas6|Do our women and children also deserve this? And that old man was not poor. He prayed to demons, performed rituals, and sacrificed animals. He lived in a hut from which he sold potions and ointments. Many believe that it was because of him that all this evil is happening to us. That he invoked something... Therefore, when our priest ordered us to burn the old man, we locked him up in his hut and burned it to the ground, listening all the while to his screams and curses.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas5_2:village_elder_caliacas6|We should not have burned him. That old man was powerful. He prayed to demons, performed rituals, and sacrificed animals. He lived in a hut from which he sold potions and ointments. Many believe that it was because of him that all this evil is happening to us. That he invoked something... Therefore, when our priest ordered us to burn the old man, we locked him up in his hut and burned it to the ground, listening all the while to his screams and curses. The only advice he left us was that we should bring three heroes, or the evil that lurks around us will end up destroying us.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas5_3:village_elder_caliacas6|That old man was powerful. He prayed to demons, performed rituals, and sacrificed animals. He lived in a hut from which he sold potions and ointments. Many believe that it was because of him that all this evil is happening to us. That he invoked something... Before our priest ordered us to burn him, he told us that we should bring three heroes, or the evil that lurks around us will end up destroying us.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas6:village_elder_caliacas6_1|You were right to call three heroes then.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas6:village_elder_caliacas7|What evil is attacking you?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas6_1:village_elder_caliacas7|Yes, I think it was the right thing to do. I'm also glad that the abbot respected my reasons, for anyone might have thought us to be heretics.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas7:village_elder_caliacas8|A month or so ago, a shepherd disappeared. A few days later, we found his dismembered body near an old tree. That scared us, because an animal would never do that to a man. After that, nobody left the village without a companion, but that did not help. A few days later, a group of people was attacked. Women and children disappeared, and we later found them dismembered.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas8:village_elder_caliacas9|--His hands tremble as he speaks.--^^Then we hired a group of Norsemen for a lot of money, but evil did the same to them as to our people, and their dismembered bodies were soon food for the crows.^^Then the old man told us to invite three heroes. Then we burned him.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas9:village_elder_caliacas10_1|Did you ask your lord for help?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas9:village_elder_caliacas10_2|You talk about evil. Why suspect the supernatural?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas10_1:village_elder_caliacas10_2|--He sighs heavily.--^^Yes, that was the first thing we did. He sent a group of twenty warriors. They were found dead and dismembered a few days later. Now our lord says he cannot send more men. He needs them for his wars. Since he had left us to our own devices, we asked the abbot.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas10_2:village_elder_caliacas11|The old gods are back, thirsty for blood after so many centuries.^^They have not only killed people and warriors, but we have seen them watching the village from afar.

; dlga_village_elder_caliacas12:village_elder_caliacas13|When there is fog, we can hear their singing and the howl of their wolves. We can even see their figures between dark wisps of fog. The creatures are huge. Well, all except her.

; dlga_village_elder_caliacas14_1:village_elder_caliacas14_2|No, not a woman, she is something else... The ancient gods have sent her to kill us all.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas14_2:village_elder_caliacas14_2|--He lowers his voice to a whisper.--^^She is Morrigan, the Phantom Queen, the pagan goddess of battle and... carnal encounters. She was worshipped before Saint Patrick brought us the word of Christ.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas14_2:village_elder_caliacas15_1|A shield-maiden?
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas14_2:village_elder_caliacas15_2|(Say nothing)
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas15_1:village_elder_caliacas15_2|What! Please speak lower. Morrigan might hear us. No, she is powerful through magic rather than through physical strength.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas15_2:village_elder_caliacas15_3|My grandfather told me stories about her. The Raven Goddess selects who is going to be slain and takes the blood from their hearts, along with their valor. When they arrive on the battlefield, they are already doomed.^^She appears as a beautiful dark haired woman or sometimes as a crow. A beautiful maiden dressed with a hooded cloak, my grandfather said. She is usually to be found by a river, washing the clothes of men about to die. Centuries ago, she was one of the Tuatha De Danann, the demons that ruled the island before the Gaels arrived. Now she lives in Sidhe, the Underworld, whose entry is the ancient mounds.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas15_3:village_elder_caliacas15_4|She has left Sidhe and has brought her beasts with her. She will destroy us unless some hero defeats her and sends her back to her world.

; dlga_village_elder_caliacas16_1:village_elder_caliacas16_2|She can't be defeated by one hero, so three were summoned. You should find them first.
; dlga_village_elder_caliacas16_2:village_elder_caliacas17|The fog always comes from the coast, and with it come Morrigan and her beasts. You have to go there if you want to find her. The other two heroes await you near the burned hut of the old man, a few hours away from this village. They are looking for more clues as they await you. Be warned! When you leave this village and move towards the coast, be alert and flee from the fog, as Morrigan and her animals could catch you before the three of you are joined.

; dlga_village_elder_caliacasdesp3_2:village_elder_caliacasdesp4|That's what I thought. Morrigan wanted to take you by surprise. We saw his wolves and bears following in your steps, and a brave lad volunteered to go to the hut of the old pagan to warn you.

Or you can force the lord to grant you parts of his rents from his fief for some time in exchange for freedom. If the lord is pagan and married, you can try to force him to divorce his wife.

; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_reject:close_window|Yes, {reg59?my lady:my lord}, of course. I am sorry if I have bothered you with our troubles.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_3b:village_elder_capture_mission_4b|I'm not sure how common this is... Why not ask your lord to help you?
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_3b:village_elder_capture_mission_4b.1|That sounds fascinating. Perhaps I will take you up on that offer when I'm ready...
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_3b:village_elder_capture_mission_4b.2|You seem to know a lot about women, my good man. This all seems so logical now.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_3b:village_elder_capture_mission_4b.3|I have to admit I'm really excited about undertaking this mission.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_3b:village_elder_capture_mission_4b.4|Perhaps we should, I can smell a good reward coming my way.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_3a:village_elder_capture_mission_4a|Would you consider taking some of my women warriors instead?

; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_3a:village_elder_capture_mission_4a.2|I have to admit that you make a lot of sense.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_3a:village_elder_capture_mission_4a.3|Your men lack willpower, but they're lowly peasants after all...
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_3a:village_elder_capture_mission_reject|Sorry, but you have failed to convince me.
; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_4a:village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c|Well, we will highly appreciate your {reg59?Ladyship's:Lordship's} helping us. What kind of reward do you have in mind?
; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_4a:village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c.1|I am glad that you can be made to see reason. Your {reg59?Ladyship's:Lordship's} help will be most appreciated, of course.
; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_4a:village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c.2|Yes, my {reg59?lady:lord}, these men are weak. They're chock full of temptations. Wouldn't it make sense for you to help them be at peace with themselves? Your help, of course, will be appreciated.
; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_4a:village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c.3|I apologize, my {reg59?lady:lord}, but my men hardly need spear-wielding warrior wives. They need women who can work the fields and take care of the animals, not pull a knife out when an argument arises.
; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_4b:village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c|Well, your {reg59?Ladyship:Lordship} could possibly understand how asking our lord to help us in a delicate matter such this could be dangerous for one's well-being.

; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_4b:village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c.1|Your {reg59?Ladyship:Lordship} will always be welcome in our village, especially if he helps us with this delicate problem. I assure you, our gratitude is not limited just to this invitation.
; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_4b:village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c.2|My {reg59?lady:lord}, I'm old and have seen and heard a lot of things. I can definitely see the way the world works.

; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_4b:village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c.3|Yes, my {reg59?lady:lord}, you really should be excited. Judging from the sparkles in your eyes, you are really up to this little challenge, aren't you? We are, too, your Highness, as it will relieve our men of their anxiety. Your help, of course, will be duly appreciated.
; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_4b:village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c.4|My {reg59?lady's:lord's} intuition is second to none. What kind of reward can you smell?
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c:village_elder_capture_mission_4d|Cash, my good man. {reg25} of it, give or take.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c:village_elder_capture_mission_4c1|Perhaps you're right. What's in it for me?
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c:village_elder_capture_mission_4c1.1|I'm sure my efforts will be appreciated, but I'd like something more tangible, like cash.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c:village_elder_capture_mission_4c1.2|Yes, I will help you, but I would require something more tangible than appreciation.
; dlga_village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c:village_elder_capture_mission_reject|Sorry, but you failed to convince me.
; dlga_village_elder_capture_mission_4c1:village_elder_tell_capture_mission_4c2|Oh, I see. {reg59?Her ladyship:His lordship} desires coins. How many would {reg59?she:he} like?

; dlga_arena_intro_2:arena_intro_3|Yes. You should see this place during one of the tournament fights. Everyone from the town and nearby villages comes here. The crowd becomes mad with excitement. Anyway, as I said, there won't be an event here soon, so there isn't much to see. Except, there is an official duel every now and then, and of course we have melee fights almost every day.

dlga_arena_training_melee_intro:arena_training_melee_intro_2|I lottatori e i cavalieri si annoiano aspettando il prossimo torneo, così hanno inventato l'addestramento in mischia. È veramente un'idea semplice. I combattenti entrano nell'arena con un'arma non letale. Non ci sono nè regole, nè squadre. Ognuno si batte contro tutti gli altri finchè ne rimane solamente uno. Sembra divertente, no?

; dlga_arena_training_melee_intro_reward:arena_training_melee_intro_2|There is, actually. Some of the wealthy townsmen offer prizes for those fighters who show great skill in the fights.

You'll get {reg12} peningas for striking down at least {reg2} opponents, {reg13} peningas if you can defeat {reg3} opponents, and {reg14} peningas if you can survive long enough to beat {reg4} opponents. If you can manage to be the last {reg59?fighter:man} standing, you'll earn the great prize of the fights, {reg15} peningas. Sounds good, eh?
