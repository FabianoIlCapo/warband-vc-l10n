ip_armies_size|Tamanho do Exército
ip_armies_size_text|O tamanho de seu exército, similar aos exércitos dos Lordes, depende de vários fatores: ^ ^ Liderança: cada ponto aumentará o tamanho máximo do seu exército em 5. Companheiros com liderança ajudam a liderar a tropa... ^ ^ Carisma: cada ponto de seu carisma irá aumentar o tamanho máximo do seu exército em 1. É sua capacidade de atrair homens para sua causa... ^ ^ Renome: cada 9 pontos aumentará o tamanho máximo do seu exército em 1. Fama atrai seguidores... ^ ^ Propriedades: cada cidade irá adicionar 80 homens e cada forte 40 para o tamanho máximo do seu exército. Estes locais representam homens que você pode recrutar através de um alistamento... ^ ^ Tenha em mente que o tamanho da tropa no mar é limitado pela capacidade do navio. As tropas extras sempre podem ser deixadas em uma guarnição de assentamento, Refúgio do jogador (uma vez construído) ou algum Quartel de Acampamento.
ip_morale|Moral
ip_morale_text|A moral representa a capacidade e a disposição das tropas sob um estandarte para juntar a resistência, coragem e disciplina de que precisam para enfrentar o stress das batalhas e as marchas. Isso não é a mesma coisa que a felicidade das tropas. Tropas de elite podem reclamar e lamentar-se sobre as dificuldades da campanha..--para então estarem juntos como um quando as flechas começarem a voar. Por outro lado, um comandante que dá a seus homens tudo o que eles querem pode descobrir que crescem macios e desistem diante do ataque inimigo... ^ ^ O maior impacto da moral é no comportamento da tropa em batalha, determinando quão agressivamente as tropas enfrenam o inimigo, e o quanto suscetíveis estão a bater em retirada caso percebam que a maré da batalha se vira contra eles. Moral também afeta a velocidade de marcha das tropas, como por exemplo uma tropa menos motivada irá mover mais lentamente, conforme os homens não estejam forçando-se ao seu limite físico e param mais freqüentemente, enquanto esperam retardatários alcançarem. Finalmente, uma tropa com a moral muito baixa começará a sofrer deserções. ^ ^ Alguns fatores que afetam a moral são intuitivos. Por exemplo, um comandante carismático com uma reputação por ganhar batalhas pode infundir seus com um senso de confiança. Líderes que dão a seus homens bem amplas e variadas fontes de alimentos e os pagam em dia, demonstram que eles se preocupam com o bem-estar de suas tropas e são menos propensos a conduzi-los ao desastre... ^ ^ Outros fatores são menos intuitivos..--particularmente aqueles relacionados ao senso de coesão grupal de uma tropa. Em um pequeno de união firme, por exemplo, os homens irão sempre lutar duro contra as possibilidades assustadoras para evitar mostrar covardia diante de seus camaradas de armas. Uma grande tropa por outro lado pode ver sua coesão tensa, pois o Comandante tem menos tempo para supervisionar os homens, ouvir suas queixas e resolver suas disputas. Batalhas freqüentes irão fortalecer os laços entre os homens, enquanto longos períodos sem combate verá as tropas ficarem entediadas e briguentas. ^ ^ O relatório de moral, acessível clicando no botão 'Info das Tropas' na tela 'Personagem', dará o jogador uma noção dos fatores que afetam a moral de seus homens.
ip_economy|Economia
ip_economy_text|Cidades e vilas nas Terras do Norte precisam de uma ampla variedade de mercadorias para as suas populações permanecerem saudáveis e produtivas. Primeira em importância é a comida. Grãos é a cultura básica das Terras do Norte, mas as pessoas também precisam de gordura e proteína na forma de carne vermelha, peixe ou queijo. Dá quase tanto trabalho preservar a carne quanto produzi-la, em primeiro lugar, então sal também está em alta demanda. Depois da comida vem vestuário: lãs pesadas, linhos mais leves ou veludos luxuosos. Finalmente, as pessoas precisam de ferramentas dos seus comércios: ferragens, cerâmica, trabalhos em couro e, claro, armas, armaduras, e cavalos para guerra ^ ^ a Maioria dos produtos agrícolas são produzidos nas vilas, enquanto os artesãos nas cidades se especializam em bens manufaturados ou artesanais como tecidos ou ferragens. Também, diferentes recursos podem ser encontrados em diferentes partes do país. Consequentemente, a chave para a prosperidade nas Terras do Norte é o comércio..-- ambos o entre as vilas e cidades e o das principais cidades entre si. ^ ^ Quando o comércio flui, mercadorias estarão disponíveis e acessíveis, a população de um assentamento estará saudável e enérgica, e migrantes se reunirão vindos das regiões vizinhas. O Assentamento vai produzir mais, consumir mais e poder contribuir mais em impostos para seus Lordes. Quando o comércio seca, cidades e vilas verão seus trabalhadores abandonarem para procurar trabalho em outro lugar, e atividade econômica irá flutuar para uma paralisação. Portanto, é do interesse dos governantes proteger as rotas de comércio contra os perigos da guerra e o banditismo. Um comerciante esperto, porém, poderá querer procurar cidades que se tornaram isoladas do resto da região, assim ele ou ela pode ser capaz de obter um lucro vindo do desequilíbrio de preços resultante. ^ ^ Porque moradores das vilas geralmente planejam levar seus produtos pro mercado das cidades, mercados de vilas serão lugares bastante tranquilos, e moradores dali vão comprar barato e vender caro. Comerciantes sérios vão se enfiar nas cidades para fazer um lucro, embora algumas tropas possam decidir fazer uma parada rápida em uma vila pra adquirir suprimentos. ^ ^ Um jogador que queira saber sobre os fatores que afetam a prosperidade da região pode falar com o prefeito da cidade local. Outras informações podem ser coletadas a partir de transeuntes, embora eles não devam saber muito fora de seu próprio comércio particular.
ip_courtship|Cortejo
ip_courtship_text|Você pode querer se casar dentro de uma das famílias nobres das Terras do Norte. Casamento não é necessário a alguém pra subir em poder e estatura, mas ele os abastece com uma oportunidade de melhorar sua relação com Lordes e estabelecer uma reivindicação ao trono. ^ ^ Requisitos de casamento serão diferentes para homens e mulheres. Uma personagem masculino geralmente precisará seguir um caminho tradicional de cortejo. Ele deve estabelecer uma reputação na sociedade aristocrática, subir em bons termos com os pais ou guardiões da moça e então esperar a noiva de acordo com os costumes locais. Se um jogador ficar impaciente, ele pode tentar pegar um atalho..--mas haverá consequências nas suas relações com outros Lordes. ^ ^ Um personagem masculino deve ter em mente que outros Lordes estarão competindo com ele pela afeição das moças do Reino. Também, o gosto de uma donzela é imprevisível, e um jogador pode também descobrir que o objeto de seu amor não o ama em troca. Romance, nas Terras do Norte como em outros lugares, nem sempre prosperar. É claro, um jogador pode recorrer a outros meios menos cavalheirescos, para ganhar o coração de uma mulher, mas novamente, isso terá um impacto grave em sua reputação... ^ ^ Para começar no caminho do cortejo, um jogador masculino deve tentar se envolver na vida social da aristocracia das Terras do Norte, frequentar banquetes e torneios. E também, trovadores vagantes e poetas podem servir como um repositório útil de informação sobre cortejo e se manter atualizado sobre as últimas fofocas.^ ^ Personagens femininas também podem se casar -- mas eles devem ter em mente que estas sociedades são muito tradicionais, e, como aventureiras, elas escolheram um caminho muito pouco convencional para uma mulher. Uma personagem feminina pode ter que procurar por um tempo para encontrar um Lorde que esteja de mente aberta o suficiente para casar com ela ^ ^ Pelo lado positivo, uma personagem feminina não tem que atravessar os elaborados rituais de cortejo, e ela também pode ganhar mais de um casamento do que sua contraparte masculina. Para uma aventureira mulher, o casamento pode ser um caminho rápido para o poder... e uma personagem sem escrúpulos pode ser capaz de usar seu marido como um instrumento de suas ambições políticas.
ip_politics|Política
; ip_politics_text|The realms of the Northlands, although they represent different cultures, all shared a basic political system that preceded feudalism. At the top of Germanic social hierarchy was the king, elected by a council of noblemen from the royal house. All the land of the realm belonged to the king, who distributed it among the aristocracy and the warriors who had performed outstanding deeds. This land however did not become their property and in case of death, either the king or the client, returned to the ruler. The nobility governed each shire in king's name with the responsibility for administration and justice, raising and leading the levies of men to the battlefield. For this purpose they divided their land into smaller parcels among the freemen who formed the backbone of the rural economy of the kingdom. These farmers and householders paid rent to their overlord and/or had several duties with him, such as building fortifications or working some days of the week during the harvest-time.^^This system of clientship was also practised between nobles, which established hierarchies of homage and political support. The increasingly powerful monasteries were autonomous ecclesiastical establishments with their own land and clients.^^A distinctive feature of the Celtic societies (Gaelic, Welsh and Pictish) was the importance of the corporate lineage-group, the clan. A large group of related people supposedly descended from one common ancestor, acting as an independent social and legal entity.^^When one realm in the Northlands makes war on another, the political unity of each kingdom is as important as the quality or number of its soldiers in determining the outcome. In a cohesive kingdom, nobles will join together in a large force to sweep their opponents before them. In a kingdom divided by petty quarrels, lords will fail to respond to the marshal's summons, or drift away to attend to their own business if a campaign is not going well. A faction's political cohesion will also impact warfare when campaigns are not in progress. In a divided faction, lords will be less likely to join together on raids and patrols or to come to each other's defense.^^If it seems nobles' bickering and quarrels are self-defeating when the enemy is just around the corner, keep in mind that ultimately, a noble's loyalty doesn't belong to a particular faction or culture, but to himself and to his family. If a noble fears that his faction is collapsing, or if he is being neglected by his liege, he can usually find a reason to withdraw his oath of allegiance and change sides. Players should keep this in mind, as they may find that there are opportunities to turn discontented former enemies into allies.
; ip_character_backgrounds|Character Backgrounds
; ip_character_backgrounds_text|A player character in the Northlands may choose to come from a variety of social backgrounds. This choice will affect not just his or her starting skills and equipment, but also the course of his or her career as an adventurer.^^War and politics in the Northlands are traditionally dominated by male aristocrats. A nobleman player character may find that he is invited into this 'old boys' club' fairly quickly, but women and commoners may face a few extra hurdles on the way. If you choose to start the game as a male nobleman, you can think of it as the 'easy' setting. Starting as a noblewoman or a male commoner is somewhat more difficult, and starting as a female commoner is probably the most challenging way to begin a game.^^However, women have some starting advantages. Simply by taking up arms, a female warrior will draw attention to herself, and she may find that she can build up her reputation faster than a male. Also, it is traditionally easier for a woman to marry up the social ladder than it is for a man, and a woman may find she can gain more from a strategic marital alliance than her male counterpart.^^Finally, keep in mind that the game does not place any limits on the upward mobility of characters based on their background. Noble or common, male or female, married or unmarried -- anyone can rise to become ruler of all the Northlands, if they are sufficiently brave, lucky, or resourceful.
; ip_military_campaigns|Military Campaigns
; ip_military_campaigns_text|When kingdoms in the Northlands go to war, their armies have two basic offensive options. They can try to attack villages and lay waste to the countryside, damaging their enemy's prestige and economy. Or, they can try to seize and hold castles or towns, taking territory. The second option can involve long, bloody sieges, but will yield more decisive results.^^It is important to note that the realms of the Northlands do not field standing armies, which remain in the field as long as the ruler desires. Rather, the realms of the Northlands are protected by the nobles, their companions, and the feudal levies they raise.  Sometimes, these nobles launch their own private attacks into enemy territory, but the most decisive events will usually take place when the great hosts are assembled. The kingdom's marshal, a noble appointed by the king, will summon the host before the campaign and lead them out to battle. However, he should be careful not to keep them in the field for too long. Otherwise, the host will begin to disintegrate, as the vassals drift off to pursue their own business, and the army will be vulnerable to a counter-attack.^^For this reason, the rhythm of wars in the Northlands often resemble the rhythm of a duel between two individual combatants. One side will gather its strength and seek to land a blow against the enemy's territory. If the marshal spends too little time gathering the vassals, he may not be able to do any real damage. If he spends too much time, then the campaign may end before it has even begun. A large realm will have an advantage over a smaller one, just as a brawny combatant has an edge over a smaller foe, but a realm's political cohesion can also be a factor, just as a fighter with great stamina can outlast her opponent. Sometimes, the armies of two realms will meet head on, resulting in a major battle in which both numbers and morale will decide the outcome.^^Kingdoms will have imperfect intelligence about their enemies. Attacking lords will need to frequently scout enemy territory to determine which fortresses may be vulnerable. An army defending its homeland will benefit from the alarms raised by castles and towns, which broadcast intelligence about enemy movements in the area. Such intelligence will be imprecise, however, particularly when it comes to numbers. A defending force which sets out to raise a siege or rescue a village may be able to overwhelm an unprepared attacker -- or it may miscalculate, and find that it is the one to be overwhelmed. Attackers, in turn, must be careful how far they advance into enemy territory, with aggressive marshals venturing further than cautious ones.^^Players will be expected to join in their faction's military campaign, either by joining the host, or by scouting ahead into enemy territory. Some players may find that their realm's marshal is too cautious, or too aggressive, for their tastes. In this case, they can intrigue with other lords to try to replace the marshal, or build support to become the marshal themselves.^^Most wars are of limited duration. A king who goes to war will, for the sake of honor, feel obligated to pursue the conflict for a short while. However, unless he is soundly beating his enemy, he may soon start looking for a way out of the conflict, lest he leave himself vulnerable to an attack by a third party. The Northlands' rulers are keenly aware that today's ally may be tomorrow's enemy, and vice versa.
; ip_siege_warfare|Siege Warfare
; ip_siege_warfare_text|Viking Conquest offers siege warfare accurate to the Dark Ages period. When the player besieges a settlement, two paths can be taken to conquer the place: by debilitation (hunger, diseases ...) or by assault.^^In the former case, the player's goal is to blockade the settlement and prevent it from receiving supplies or reinforcements. At the same time various actions can be performed to undermine morale, spread disease or destroy the food reserves of the settlement. This type of action will take longer, but also avoid a large number of casualties.^^In the latter case, direct action is undertaken, provided assault equipment is available or preparatory actions have been taken, such as wearing down the defenders or burning their houses and walls. This option should be used when the player feels ready to launch a full-scale assault to conquer the settlement. It has the advantage of leading to success more quickly, but usually at a relatively high cost in lives.^^In addition, when the settlement has a port, the player may equip a fleet and assault the port, leading an assault from the sea.^^The complexity and characteristics of the new siege system are too numerous to describe here in detail. The best thing is to discover and develop strategies on your own.
; ip_sea_travel|Sea Travel
; ip_sea_travel_text|Ferries on the world map transport your party between two stations. While this is cheap when your party is small, it becomes more expensive with party size.^^To travel longer distances on the sea, one may travel from one port town to another. This can be initiated from the town menu or by talking to the shipwright in the port part of the town scene. Similar to ferries, this service becomes more expensive with party size.^^Once you have your own ship, you may embark from the port it is in by clicking on 'Sail from port' in the town menu. You will return to the map, but this time at sea on your ship. Sea travel then works much like land travel.^^There are two different ways to get back on land. You can either click on a port or use a landing point. To find a landing point, travel closely along the coast or right click on your party and select 'find closest landing point.' As with ports, click on the landing point to disembark. In either case, your ships will remain at the position where you landed.^^If your party's size is greater than the capacity of your ships, you won't be able to embark. In this case, you can establish troop quarters (Camp menu) at your current position and another troop quarters at your target position, then transport your army step by step between both quarters.^^When traveling by sea on the campaign map, you can always check the current weather. After clicking on the 'Camp' button, current conditions are shown on the left side. If the weather conditions change, you will be notified by a message in the lower left corner of the screen.^^On the one hand, windy weather is good for the speed of your ships on the campaign map and in sea battles. On the other hand, the chance that it will damage your ships also increases. Damage worsens the condition of a ship, slowing it or even destroying when the condition reaches 'Dangerous.' You may check the conditions of your ships by clicking on 'Camp' and then on 'Fleet.'^^Finally, the weather also determines the behaviour of ships in battle. This can always be checked beforehand by clicking 'Camp' and then on 'Check location.'^^Sea travel is dangerous and can lower the morale of your troops. When this happens, you will be notified by a message. Troops especially dislike spending the night on the water. Therefore, consider plotting your route to make landfall by night. If morale on the sea gets too low, troops may mutiny.^^Some troops like Sailors and certain Norse troops are experienced seamen and will increase the travel speed of your ships on the campaign map. You can check the effect on the left side of the camp menu.^^If there is more than one ship in your fleet, the speed of the fleet is determined by its slowest ship. However, as soon as you have more than one ship in your fleet, you can split the fleet. To do so, travel close to a shore. Then click on 'Camp', 'Fleet' and finally on 'Leave ship at shore' to leave the slower ship(s) there. To bring ships together again, one needs to bring them all to a port. To get a overview of all your ships at their location, click on 'Character' and then on 'Ships.'
; ip_sea_battle|Sea Battle
; ip_sea_battle_text|At some point after starting to travel on the sea, you will participate in a naval battle.^^First of all, you need to know how to control your ship. You can give the command to row forward, fast forward, backwards, or stay. The up and down arrow keys switch between these commands. You can also give the command to go straight, starboard, hard starboard, port or hard port. The left and right arrow keys switch between these commands.^^Current commands are represented by arrows around the representation of your ship in the upper right corner. Press Enter to set the sail and Backspace to get a tactical view of the scene. Try these commands to get a feeling for steering a ship and the effect of the wind.^^As soon as you get close enough to an enemy ship, boarding will commence. The ships are lashed together and the fight starts.^If you are lucky, you may capture the enemy flagship after winning the fight.^^In a sea battle where you have several ships, you can give a 'stand ground' or 'charge' command to your ships, which are assigned to the ninth 'division.' The first troops in your army list will be together with you on the flagship. The other troops will be in the remaining ships. One can change one's flagship in a port or while camping on the sea.^^With a reasonably large fleet, one may attack towns from their sea sides. To do so, simply click on the enemy port town and you will have option to attack it once you reach it without first disembarking.
; ip_ship_info|Ships
; ip_ship_info_text|Sooner or later, you'll want to invest in a ship. There are several reasons to do this. Over the long term, it is the cheapest form of sea travel. It gives you complete freedom in movement on the sea. It opens new opportunities for trading and raiding.^^On the other hand, there are downsides. First of all, a ship is expensive, and you will have to save up some money to afford one. Furthermore, a ship can carry only a limited amount of troops.^^Another important consideration is speed. With a faster ship, you will more successfully catch or flee from other ships. The speed of a ship is determined by its type and condition.^^Finally the wood used for ship construction affects its durability. While ships made of oak wood are very durable, ships made of beech wood need to be repaired more often.^^When you feel ready to buy a ship, click on 'See the ships' in the town menu of a port town or talk to the shipwright. Port towns can have up to three ships for sale, but sometimes none are available. The type and amount of ships offered changes over time. While all port towns offer ships, one finds the best ships in Norse and Frisian ports. To see your ship, you can click on 'See the ships' in the town menu or walk to its pier.^^In a port, one may customize the sail of a ship or paint any ship made of oak. There is one special sail which is reserved for the ships of the player. It can be changed with a dedicated graphic editor (not included in Viking Conquest). For further information, see the 'Your Custom Sails' folder among the files of this DLC.^^Once you have a ship, the shipwright will interact with you in a different way and won't hesitate to offer advice. Shipwrights also offer to custom build ships. Better ships may require special materials that you will need to obtain and bring with you. Better ships also require more time for their construction and the more talented shipwrights in Norse ports. Ships you have built can be named freely in the ship customization menu.^

; ip_recruitment|Recruitment
; ip_recruitment_text|Recruitment in Viking Conquest is not automatic but depends on a number of factors.^^Firstly, in order to recruit in a village, fort or town, you need to obtain the permission of its lord. To do this, you'll need to have enough renown (150+) and be on good terms with the lord and his faction.^^For villages, you can also obtain permission from the village leader. For this route, you may use high renown (150+) and high relations (15+), or you can just try bribery. Bribing may or may not work, so you may have to try to bribe the leader more than once.^^Once permission is obtained, you are free to recruit as long as your relations with the settlement remain positive. In villages you may be able to recruit tier 1 troops. If have high enough relations (60+), you may be able to recruit tier 2 troops. If you happen to be the village's lord, you need only 20+ relations to do this.^^In castles and towns, you maybe able to recruit tier 2 troops. If your relations with the place are high enough (30+), there is 30% chance you may get a tier 3 troop. The maximum number of troops that you may be able to recruit is determined by your relations with the settlement, your leadership, your charisma, your religion, the predominant religion of the settlement, and whether or not you are the lord of the place.^^Other options are available. If you're Christian, you may be able to find some desperate refugees in monasteries. There is always a chance to find fellows looking for work at farmsteads.
; ip_wages|Wages
; ip_wages_text|Troop wages in Viking Conquest are affected primarily by the player's leadership. For higher level troops, the player's persuasion skill may become a bonus or a malus, depending on how good it is. For outlaw type troops, such as Robbers and Vikings, the player's reputation comes into play, giving a discount if player's reputation is worse than Notorious.
; ip_skills|Skills and Attributes
; ip_skills_text|When creating or developing a character in Viking Conquest, one has to pay attention to the many skills and attributes. Skills like persuasion and leadership are essential for trading, wages, lord and lady interaction, and forced conversion. Attributes such as intelligence and charisma are also essential in these activities, but will also affect your ability to marry or lead people.^^There are three important skills for the sea: 'Sea King,' 'Navigation' and 'Looting.'^^One's Sea King level determines the amount of ships one can command. Level one allows up to two ships. Seven ships are the maximum at the Sea King level of four.^^The Navigation skill allows one to travel faster on the sea. It is the naval equivalent of the Pathfinding skill on land (which, by the way, will not help on the sea).^^A higher Looting skill results in a higher chance of capturing enemy ships.^

If the village is looted, or fort or town is plundered, the entry in your budget will state that no rents are available. Once the village/fort/town is back to normal state, they will restart processing rent payments.
